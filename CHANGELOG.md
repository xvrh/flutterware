## Unreleased

- **A project's own shaders load, and scene text can be painted with one.**
  The shaders a pubspec declares under `flutter: shaders:` were never in the
  bundle flutterware renders from, so `FragmentProgram.fromAsset` failed with
  *"Asset not found"* in every lane — previews, scenarios, scene video, the
  studio's canvases. They are compiled and bundled now, and a `.frag` saved
  while a preview or a scene is open is reloaded in place.

  A scene text layer takes `ShaderPaint('shaders/foil.frag', uniforms: …)`:
  the pass is painted by the shader through the glyphs, over the whole text
  or once per line, with `uSize`, `uColor` and `uTime` set by the renderer
  when the shader declares them. A pass paints nothing until its program has
  loaded. The lanes wait for that themselves; a plain widget test does not,
  so it loads them first with
  `await tester.runAsync(() => precacheSceneShaders(scene));`.

## 0.6.0

Development tooling for Flutter projects: a desktop app, a command line and an
MCP server over one set of tools you declare once.

```sh
dart pub add flutterware
dart run flutterware
```

That opens the studio. It also scaffolds `tool/flutterware.dart` and registers
the MCP server in `.mcp.json`. Declare the tools you want in that file and each
one becomes a panel, an `fw` command and an MCP action — the three surfaces run
the same code, so an agent can do what you can do from the window.

- **Previews** — your `@Preview` widgets on real device frames, live, with
  knobs, screenshots and inspection. macOS only for now; everything else runs
  everywhere.
- **Scenarios** — a `flutter_test` that screenshots itself, and draws its flow.
- **Run** — launch an entry point on any device, then drive and inspect it: by
  hand, from `fw`, or from an agent.
- **Store screenshots** — the images a store listing is uploaded from, taken
  from scenarios, per locale and display class.
- **Comparison** — `fw compare` reports what this branch did to the pictures,
  against its base.
- **Scenes** — a scene and its motion in one file, rendered by your app and
  exportable to video.
- Also: dependencies, assets, translations, lints, renders, native splash,
  launcher icon, server inspection, a dev stack and a changes view.

Every capability of every surface: [docs/capabilities.md](docs/capabilities.md).
Needs Flutter 3.47.
