/// This is the lane a project keeps when it has an existing map-based catalog
/// and a test that pumps every entry to see that none of them throws. That test
/// needs the same fact the panel needs — a desktop entry has to be pumped on a
/// desktop-sized surface, or it reports overflows that are not real — and until
/// this was exported the only way to get it was to reimplement the device table
/// by hand, or to reach into a private function.
///
/// The canvas list here is the shape a project would keep in its own package
/// and hand to `tool/flutterware.dart` as well, which is the whole point: one
/// list, so the tool and the test cannot disagree about what a directory is
/// meant to look like.
