/// The work is a root-zone timer rather than an asset read on purpose. Under a
/// bare `flutter test` an asset read is not real-loop work at all:
/// `UNIT_TEST_ASSETS` makes `flutter_test` answer `flutter/assets` from a
/// `readAsBytesSync`, so it completes under FakeAsync and this file would be
/// green while the runner's lane — which spawns `flutter_tester` directly and
/// gets the engine's answer — stayed red. `Zone.root` is the one spelling of
/// "off the fake clock" that both lanes agree on.
