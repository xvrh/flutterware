/// captures at the device's own ratio, so an automatic step on a 6.9" iPhone
/// was being rasterized and encoded at eleven times the pixels of a 1× run,
/// written out, and thrown away with the scratch directory.
///
/// The half worth testing hardest is the last group. Every other mode decides
/// from the *screen*, and adoption only happens where the screen has not
/// moved — so a held capture and the shot adopting it agree by construction.
/// This one decides from the *step*, which breaks that, and the symptom is
/// silent: a named shot lands on a frame that was never rendered and the export
/// writes an empty file.
