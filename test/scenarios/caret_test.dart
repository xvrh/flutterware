/// The blinking caret, and why a run holds it still.
///
/// On iOS a `TextField` animates its caret through an `AnimationController`
/// rather than a timer, so a screen with a focused field never stops asking
/// for frames. No settle policy can tell that from a spinner, and the two that
/// do not stop at the first quiet frame — [Settle.elapse], which is what a
/// boot-time pump spends, and [Settle.none] — land wherever the blink happens
/// to be. The step then reports `settled: false` on the phase of an animation
/// nobody is waiting for, and the caret's opacity in the pixels moves with it
/// — enough for a `screen` to refuse to adopt its verb's frame and emit a
/// second step instead.
