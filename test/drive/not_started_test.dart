/// The generated wrapper installs the guest *around* the app's `main`, so
/// `ext.flutterware.act` is registered and answering before a single widget is
/// mounted. An app whose `main` throws — a config fetch against a dead port was
/// the reported case — stays there: the isolate lives, the VM service answers,
/// and every verb behind the extension walks a tree that is not there.
///
/// It used to answer `Null check operator used on a null value`, thrown by the
/// finder that `observe` runs. That is the worst sentence available — it names
/// flutterware for a failure in the app, and a consumer lost real time to it.
///
/// Plain `test`, not `testWidgets`, and that is the point. The test binding
/// mounts a `[root]` element of its own before the first `pumpWidget`, so
/// inside `testWidgets` this state cannot be reached at all; with only the
/// binding ensured, `rootElement` is null and `renderViews` is empty, which is
/// exactly what a real app looks like before `runApp`. A mounted app takes the
/// untouched path and is covered by every other drive and scenario test.
