# Comparison in CI — a PR comment with pictures

`fw compare --report=<dir>` emits everything a pull-request comment needs;
what it deliberately does not do is host or post. A GitHub comment can only
show images by URL, and where those URLs live — an orphan branch, GitHub
Pages, a bucket — is the repository's business. So the report is three files
with two placeholders, and the workflow below is the fifteen lines that
finish the job.

## What `--report` emits

```
<dir>/
  comment.md    the verdict in the heading, the viewer link up top, and the
                table of findings folded into a <details> whose rows
                deep-link into the page (`#previews/<entry>`,
                `#scenarios/<flow>/<step>`) — with __MOSAIC_URL__ and
                __VIEWER_URL__ placeholders
  mosaic.png    a grid of the findings (capped at 20), base beside head,
                changed regions boxed — only written when something changed
  web/          the browsable page: viewer, index.json, a PNG per frame.
                Serve over HTTP; file:// cannot fetch its own frames.
```

The page resolves everything against its own URL, so it runs at a bucket root
and under `…/comparisons/42/` alike with nothing to configure. The one host
that needs telling is one that serves a directory without redirecting to a
trailing slash — give it `--base-href=/comparisons/42/`.

## A workflow that hosts on an orphan branch

One self-contained way to do it, on stock GitHub and nothing else. An orphan
branch holds the files; raw.githubusercontent serves the **mosaic** and
GitHub Pages serves the **viewer** from that same branch. Two hosts on
purpose: the viewer is a Flutter web app and raw serves scripts as
`text/plain` with nosniff, which browsers refuse — while Pages takes a
minute to build after a push, which the click on "Open the full comparison"
can afford and the inline image cannot.

One-time setup: Settings → Pages → deploy from a branch →
`comparison-artifacts`, `/ (root)`.

        # `g` matters: a scenario row carries two viewer links on one line.
        sed -e "s|__MOSAIC_URL__|$RAW/mosaic.png|g" \
            -e "s|__VIEWER_URL__|$PAGES/pr-$PR/web/|g" \
            comparison-report/comment.md > comment.md
        # One comment per PR, updated in place — found again by its marker.
        id=$(gh api "repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/$PR/comments" \
          --jq '[.[] | select(.body | startswith("<!-- fw-compare -->"))][0].id // empty')
        if [ -n "$id" ]; then
          gh api -X PATCH "repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/$id" -F body=@comment.md
        else
          gh pr comment "$PR" --body-file comment.md
        fi
```

Adapt freely — the contract is only: substitute the two placeholders
everywhere they appear (`sed …g` — `__VIEWER_URL__` is once per table row),
then post `comment.md`. The comment's first line is `<!-- fw-compare -->`
precisely so a workflow can find its own comment and update it rather than
stack a new one per push; the footer's `@<sha>` says which push the report
still describes.

## Several packages, one comment

`fw compare` covers **every** package either half declares — previews in
`app` and `packages/gallery`, scenarios in `app` and `packages/notes` — and
writes one `index.json`, one `comment.md` and one page for all of them. There
is nothing to configure and no reason to run it once per package; doing so
would produce a comment each, and each run would overwrite the last one's
artifact.

`--package=` narrows, and it is repeatable:

```sh
dart run flutterware compare --package=app --package=packages/notes
```

Two things change in the output when a run covers more than one package, and
nothing changes when it covers one:

- **A row's id carries its package** — `packages/gallery/demo/card.dart#card`,
  which is the file's path plus the name it was declared under. Without it two
  packages that both declare `demo/card.dart#card` are one row.
- **A row also carries a `package` field**, recorded whether or not the id was
  qualified, so a script over `index.json` never has to take an id apart.

A package whose catalog or harness will not compile against the base is one
package's worth of silence, not the end of the run: the others still report,
the half records a note naming the package and the compiler's output, and the
comment leads with **no verdict** so the failure cannot read as a pass. `fw
compare` still exits non-zero. When it is the *only* package, it is still the
whole comparison — the command prints the diagnostics and exits 64.

Packages are compared one at a time. Each is two `frontend_server`s and two
guests, and a runner sized for one build will not hold four of those at once;
since the scenario half stopped building harnesses it does not need, a package
a branch did not touch costs milliseconds anyway.

## Why `--frames=changed`

The page has to carry every picture it shows, because it is read where nobody
has the shot cache — and on a run where the skip rule did not earn its keep,
almost all of them are pictures of rows that came out **identical**. Measured
on one export: 18.1MB of frames for 220 unchanged entries against 1.5MB for
the 24 findings.

`--frames=changed` writes the findings' frames only. The verdict is untouched
— every row is still in `index.json` with its state and its channels, and a
script over the file sees exactly what it saw before — and an unchanged entry
opens on a sentence saying its picture was left out rather than pretending
nothing rendered. A scenario that *is* a finding keeps every one of its steps,
holes and all being worse than weight.

Leave it off for a page somebody browses rather than gates on: without the
frames it cannot show you what a branch did not touch, which is a real thing
to want to see. That is why the default is `all`.

## What to know before turning it on

- **The two caches, and what each buys.** `~/.flutterware/shots` holds the
  rendered pictures and the scenario replays, content-addressed: without it a
  runner renders and replays *both sides of every row, every run*, and with it
  a push whose inputs did not move replays nothing, and a base is replayed
  once however many pull requests compare against it. A replay whose requests
  went out to a live network, or one the harness gave up on, is never filed.
  `fw compare` trims it at the end of every run — anything unread for two
  weeks, then the oldest past 2GB — so a restored cache stays bounded without
  a cleanup step of your own; so do the base checkouts and each checkout
  path's comparison directory. `~/.flutterware/kernels` holds the **seed kernel** —
  a compiled kernel of the half of the program no checkout owns, the SDK and
  the pub cache — and it is what a cold harness compile starts from instead of
  starting from nothing. Measured on this repository, a scenario harness
  compiled cold took 60s and the same one starting from a seed came up inside
  a 9s half. The `restore-keys` line matters: a lockfile change should reuse
  the previous run's cache and write a new one, not start empty.
- **Do not cache `~/.flutterware/bases`.** The base checkout is a real
  `git worktree`, registered inside the repository's own `.git` — which a
  fresh CI checkout does not have, so a restored one is a directory git does
  not believe in. It is also disposable by design: it gets checked out again
  in seconds, and the pictures that took the time are in the shot cache.
- **Both sides are rendered with the SDK you run `fw compare` under**, and the
  base with its own `package:flutterware`. A branch that moves either compares
  two instruments as well as two commits, and the verdict says so rather than
  leaving you a guard to write: widget-tree differences between two versions
  of flutterware's reader are listed but not counted, and a base whose
  `.fvmrc` (or `.fvm/fvm_config.json`, or `.tool-versions`) pins a different
  Flutter from this branch's gets a sentence saying its pixels may be the
  SDK's. Both land under the comment's heading, on the page, and in
  `index.json` as `caveats`.
- **`fetch-depth: 0`.** The base is the merge base with the default branch; a
  shallow clone has no common commit and the compare refuses, naming the ref.
- **The very first comment of a repository may briefly 404 its page link**:
  Pages builds after the push, in about a minute. Every later run updates a
  site that already exists. A downloaded artifact opens on `file://`, which
  cannot run the page — it has to be served, and the branch is the serving.
- **Old directories are just directories.** A closed pull request's `pr-N/`
  on the branch is linked by nothing; delete whenever the branch feels heavy.
- **The page fetches its rendering engine from `www.gstatic.com`**, so a
  runner behind a firewall that blocks it gets a blank page. The engine is
  ~38MB and is *not* copied into the export for exactly that reason; there is
  no flag here that changes it, and the scenario export's *Offline* toggle is
  the one place that does.
