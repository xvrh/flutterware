/// An app that reads the asset bundle at boot — and the guard that the two
/// lanes agree about it.
///
/// This is the shape that used to be green under `flutter test` and red under
/// `fw run scenarios`: `flutter test` sets `UNIT_TEST_ASSETS`, which makes
/// `flutter_test` answer `flutter/assets` from a `readAsBytesSync` rather than
/// from the engine, so the read completes under FakeAsync. The directly
/// spawned tester did not, so the same code rendered blank here.
///
/// [Shot.skip] on the pump is load-bearing: a captured step runs inside
/// `tester.runAsync`, which gives the real event loop a turn and hides the
/// difference. A project that skips the capture — as a project with its own
/// `pumpApp` does — is the one that sees it.
