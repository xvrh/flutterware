/// ```sh
/// dart run tool/stack.dart up          # start the toy server in the background
/// dart run tool/stack.dart status      # what state is it in
/// dart run tool/stack.dart logs        # what has it been saying
/// dart run tool/stack.dart hit /users  # send it a request
/// dart run tool/stack.dart down        # stop it
/// ```
///
/// The subject is `bin/example_server.dart` — the toy HTTP server this project
/// already ships for the server-inspection panel. That makes the pair worth
/// looking at together: bring the stack up here, and the Server panel fills
