# The store listing's phone, built in Blender and exported as glTF.
#
# `make_probe_rig_blender.py` builds a *probe* — a box with a lid, whose job is
# to answer questions about the pipeline. This builds the thing a listing
# actually shows: a phone with rounded corners, a camera bump and a screen a
# scene binds a screenshot to. Run headless, from `examples/example`:
#
#     /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background \
#         --python tool/make_phone_blender.py
#
# It follows the surface convention the spec writes down (2026-09-05-scene-3d-
# view-design.md § 2) and which the walk tests hold:
#
#   * the object's name is the glTF node's name, so `mesh: 'Screen'` finds it;
#   * a plane facing -Y in Blender faces the viewer after export;
#   * the exporter flips V, so Blender's default plane UVs land top-left —
#     which is the only reason a bound screenshot is not upside down;
#   * everything is centred on the origin, so the orbit camera's target is the
#     phone rather than a corner of it.
#
# There is deliberately no animation here. The probe rig carries a clip because
# clips had to be proven; a phone in a store banner turns because the scene's
# timeline keys `rotationY` on its placement, and a row on the timeline is the
# thing worth showing.
#
# No screen aspect is invented: 0.68 x 1.473 is 19.5:9, which is what every
# phone the listing targets is.
