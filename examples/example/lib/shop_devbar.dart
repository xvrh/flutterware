/// call — from a button in the in-app overlay, from the cockpit's App tab,
/// from `fw`, or from an agent:
///
/// ```sh
/// fw run run panelInvoke --panel=push --action=send \
///   --args='{"title": "Your order is ready", "link": "/cart"}'
/// ```
///
/// The running app shows the banner, which can then be tapped — by a person or
/// by `flutterware_act` — to follow the deep link. None of it reaches around
/// the app: `PushService` is Brewline's own code and the plugin only calls it,
/// so what gets exercised is the real path.
///
/// Run it: the **Brewline (devbar)** entry point in the run panel, or
/// `flutter run -t lib/shop_devbar.dart`.
