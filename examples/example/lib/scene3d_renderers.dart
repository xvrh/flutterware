// The renderers for the scene's registered 3D kinds, in the app — the
// half the core does not import.
//
// A `View3DNode` is drawn by [scene3dRenderers]: one flutter_scene scene per
// view, one loaded asset per `ModelNode` or `SurfaceNode` child, the orbit
// camera and every transform read off the nodes' rows *as rendered*, so a
// motion's tracks reach the picture. Loading goes through `RealWork.run`
// (the export walk waits for it), and the asset is the build-time
// `.fsceneb` the app's hook wrote. Register with
// `SceneView(renderers: scene3dRenderers)` or the canvas host's
// `renderers:`.
//
// A surface is a placement with a slot. Its first child is drawn by the
// view — handed in through the renderer's child callback, live — and
// captured by flutter_scene onto the material of the mesh the surface
// names, or onto a quad of this file's own when the surface names no asset.
// The capture is asynchronous; the component's controller says when a new
// texture landed, and the view repaints on it so the frame that carries it
// gets drawn — which is what keeps a walk's photograph at the playhead's
// moment rather than one capture behind.
