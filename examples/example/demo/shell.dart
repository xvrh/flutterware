/// The app chrome a demo needs to look like itself: theme, localizations,
/// directionality.
///
/// Demos are widgets, not apps — the catalog renders the widget and nothing
/// else — so anything that normally comes from `MaterialApp` has to be put back
/// by a wrapper. This is that wrapper, and it is shared rather than repeated
/// because a demo that themes itself differently from the app is not a preview
/// of the app.
///
/// Wrapping it in a [CatalogShell] is what puts the switches below in the
/// catalog's top bar, where they apply to every demo and stay put as you move
/// between them. It changes nothing anywhere else: this is still a plain
/// `Widget Function(Widget)`, and outside the catalog — in the real app, or in
/// Flutter's own previewer — each switch answers with the default written here.
