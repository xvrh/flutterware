/// It exists to hold the run guest to a non-`package:` entry point. The
/// wrapper the launch generates has to name three things three different ways:
/// this file by path, [Seed] beside it by path, and `MyHomePage` by the
/// `package:` URI it does have. Wrapping used to be refused here outright — no
/// knobs, no inspect, no act — on the grounds that a file outside `lib/` has no
/// `package:` URI for the wrapper to import. It does not need one.
///
/// `demo/` rather than a directory of its own because that is where this
/// package already keeps what is dev-only, and the previews plugin already
/// scans it — a config sending previews to `demo/` while its run plugin refused
/// `demo/` was one file disagreeing with itself.
