/// Brewline's screens, one preview each.
///
/// The app the scenarios drive, taken apart: `test/scenarios/mobile/shop_test.dart`
/// walks welcome → menu → drink → cart → confirmation as one flow, and these
/// are the same screens standing still, where a spacing or a dark-mode
/// question can be answered without replaying four taps to reach the screen
/// that asks it.
///
/// Every entry goes through [wrapInShop]: these screens read
/// `Cart.of(context)` and `ShopStrings.of(context)`, so a bare widget throws.
/// That is the ordinary case for previewing a screen out of an app, and the
/// wrapper is the ordinary answer to it.

/// The shell is the shop itself: `ShopApp` takes the screen as its home, so a
/// preview reads the app's theme, strings and cart rather than a copy of
/// them, and the two axes a reader can turn are the ones the app supports —
/// dark, and the two languages of its strings.
///
/// [cart] is how a screen that is only interesting with contents gets some —
/// an empty cart screen is a picture of the empty state, which is worth having
/// too, and is what the default gives. A `Cart` per build rather than a
/// shared one: a preview rebuilds whenever a knob moves, and a cart that
/// accumulated a cappuccino on every rebuild would tell you about the preview
/// rather than about the screen.
