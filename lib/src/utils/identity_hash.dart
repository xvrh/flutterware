/// 1. **Anchor on the exact syntactic shape the emitter produces**, never on
///    "digits look like noise". That discipline is what keeps
///    `ValueKey('build#a1b2c')` — the author's own value, and the only thing
///    telling two of those apart — intact.
/// 2. **Only what no project can make deterministic.** A project's own
///    `Uuid()` and `DateTime.now()` do not belong here; those are bugs to
///    report, not noise to hide.

/// `describeIdentity` and `shortHash` render an object as its type followed by
/// five hex characters of `hashCode`, which the VM assigns per allocation. The
/// same controller therefore spells itself differently in every process and
/// after every rebuild, and [InspectNode] exists to be *carried between*
/// processes — so a value that means nothing outside the one that minted it
/// cannot travel in it. Left in, it cost a previews comparison 21 entries
/// reported as changed with nothing changed about them.
///
/// Anchored on a **type-shaped** token — uppercase or `_` initial, generics
/// allowed — or on the `[` of a bare `UniqueKey`, because that is precisely
/// what `describeIdentity` emits. A lower-case word before the `#` is nobody's
/// hash: `ValueKey('build#a1b2c')` is the author's own value, and the only
/// thing telling two of those apart, so it keeps every character.
///
/// **Unless the bracket already opened with a type.** `GlobalObjectKey` and
/// `ObjectKey` spell themselves as their own type, a space, and
/// `describeIdentity` of the object they identify — so the token before the
/// `#` is the *value's* runtime type and may be anything at all, lower-case
/// included: `[GlobalObjectKey int#8cc0b]`. That one slipped through
/// the rule above and cost a consumer every scenario of a `go_router` app
/// reported as changed, forever: `_CustomNavigator` keys itself with a
/// `GlobalObjectKey` over an `int`, so it is in the tree of every routed
/// screen and in none of the previews, which mount a widget directly. The
/// first alternative below admits a lower-case type token, and only where a
/// type-shaped one has already opened the bracket — which is what keeps
/// `ValueKey`'s `[<'build#a1b2c'>]` out of it.
///
/// Both the fields that carry a rendered object go through here — a widget's
/// [InspectNode.properties] and its resolved [InspectNode.textStyle] — which
/// is the point of doing it beside [shortenPropertyValue] rather than at each
/// call site. [InspectNode.splitKey] uses it for the same reason on keys.
