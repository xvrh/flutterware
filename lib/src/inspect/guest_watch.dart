/// Tells the host when what it is looking at has moved, without being asked.
///
/// **The problem this exists for.** A tree is of one build. Entry switch,
/// reload, knob and axis change all notify; nothing notifies when the *demo's
/// own* state moves. That was invisible while a stale tree only showed slightly
/// wrong numbers — but once hovering a row draws a rectangle on screen, a stale
/// tree visibly lies: you hover `Padding` and a box appears over nothing.
///
/// **Why not push the tree every frame.** An animation almost never changes
/// tree structure. It changes geometry. Re-sending fifty identical nodes with
/// different rects sixty times a second, to move one rectangle, spends the most
/// in exactly the case the feature was turned on for. So two things are watched
/// separately, and only the one that changed is reported:
///
/// | tier | what moves | what is pushed |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | geometry | the watched node's box | the box |
/// | structure | the shape of the element tree | a flag — the host re-reads |
/// | resize | the demo's own box | a flag — every rect is stale at once |
/// | scroll | the offsets under a scrollable | a flag — the host waits, then re-reads |
///
/// The structure tier pushes a **flag, not a tree**. The host already knows how
/// to read `ext.flutterware.tree`; what it cannot do is know when to. Shipping
/// the tree inside the event would put the expensive walk on the frame that
/// detected the change, which is the frame that can least afford it.
///
/// Off unless somebody is looking: a guest nobody is inspecting pays nothing,
/// which is why this is a switch and not an install.
