/// A capture on disk, read when something resolves it and not before.

/// The laziness is the point: [StoreShot.set] is the whole set, so an eager
/// provider makes every job read every file — 225 reads for a fifteen-shot set,
/// nearly all of them for pictures no frame paints.
///
/// **Why this is not a `FileImage`.** `FileImage` is lazy already and hangs
/// here, for a reason that is about the test binding rather than about files.
/// An `Image` in the pumped tree resolves its own provider during
/// `pumpWidget`, so the load starts inside `FakeAsync`'s zone — where
/// `scheduleMicrotask` is overridden to a queue that only `flushMicrotasks`
/// drains, and only `pump` calls that. `FileImage`'s load awaits
/// `File.length()`, whose completion arrives on the real event loop but whose
/// continuation is scheduled as one of those queued microtasks. `runAsync`
/// runs the real loop and never drains that queue, so the load parks mid-read
/// and the [precacheImage] below — which finds the very same parked completer
/// in the image cache — waits on it forever. Measured: the future advances one
/// step per alternating `pump`/`runAsync` pair, five pairs to finish one PNG.
///
/// Reading with `readAsBytesSync` removes every `dart:io` await, leaving only
/// the engine's own decode — which completes through a synchronous completer,
/// resuming in place rather than through the queue. That is the shape
/// `MemoryImage` has, and the reason it worked.
///
/// Keyed by path **and by what was at it**, so two jobs painting the same
/// neighbour share one decode through the image cache — where the eager
/// `MemoryImage`s, compared by byte identity, could only ever share within a
/// job — and a rerun over a rewritten capture does not.
///
/// The second half of that key is not optional, and the reason is the guest.
/// `StoreFrameRunner` keeps it warm on purpose, `flutter_test` never clears
/// `PaintingBinding.imageCache`, and the capture path an export composes from
/// is fully deterministic — same output, same store, same class, same locale,
/// same numbered name, run after run. A key of path alone therefore *hits* on
/// the previous export's decode: the app changes, the capture on disk changes,
/// and the composition ships the pixels from last time. Measured before this
/// stamp existed, driving two composes over one path whose bytes were replaced
/// in between: byte-identical output. The same key also cached the *failure* of
/// an unreadable capture, so fixing one and exporting again kept reporting it
/// broken until the studio was restarted.
///
/// A stat rather than a hash of the bytes, because the bytes are what this
/// exists not to read. Resolution is the filesystem's — measured here at
/// microseconds, and an export is tens of seconds of running an app, so two
/// captures at one path never share a stamp. A missing file stats to
/// `notFound`, size -1 and epoch, which is a stable key that fails at read time
/// like any other unreadable capture rather than throwing here.
///
/// Two tests hold this in place: `test/store/shot_image_test.dart` for the
