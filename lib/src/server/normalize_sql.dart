/// Reduces a SQL statement to its shape, so queries differing only in their

/// This is what makes N+1 detection possible at all — the queries of an N+1
/// differ *precisely* in their literals (`user_id = 1`, `= 2`, `= 3`), so
/// exact-string grouping sees N distinct queries (spec decision 12). The
/// ruleset is the well-trodden one: literals become `?`, `IN` lists collapse,
/// whitespace folds.
///
/// Runs on the attacher side — the wire carries raw SQL, so these rules can
/// improve with flutterware releases without touching anyone's server.
///
/// Deliberately conservative: under-normalizing splits a group, which costs a
/// missed badge; over-normalizing merges *distinct* queries, which reports a
/// problem that does not exist. Double-quoted tokens are identifiers in
/// standard SQL and are left alone for that reason, even though MySQL would
/// read some of them as strings.
