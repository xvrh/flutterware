/// The channel protocol's second transport: an inspected **Flutter app**,
/// reached over the VM service from the host.
///
/// The socket transport (`inspector.dart`) can write to a peer whenever it
/// likes. This one cannot: a VM service extension is request/response, and the
/// only thing an app can push is `postEvent`. So the shape here is the hybrid
/// Decision 5 of the design settled on:
///
/// - **the host pulls.** Every call to [channelExtension] hands the core a
///   frame (or nothing) and comes back with whatever that peer has queued —
///   hello, replay, live events, responses.
/// - **the app nudges.** When frames queue up with no call in flight, the app
///   posts one payload-free [channelNudgeKind] event meaning "there is
///   something to pull".
///
/// **The nudge is coalesced, and that is the whole trick.** At most one is
/// outstanding per peer between drains, so the nudge rate is bounded by how
/// often the host pulls, never by how fast events arrive. A bulk sync writing
/// five thousand rows produces one nudge, not five thousand — which is what
/// makes it safe to put this on the same `Extension` stream Flutter already
/// posts `Flutter.Frame` to on every frame.
///
/// Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-devbar-run-bridge-design.md`.
