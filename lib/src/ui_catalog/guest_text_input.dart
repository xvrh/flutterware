/// The guest's text input — what lets a demo's `TextField` receive typing.
///
/// The guest has no platform text input: the host is a few hundred lines of C
/// with nothing on the other end of `flutter/textinput`, so the platform
/// control's messages go into the void and no field could ever receive a
/// character. This control replaces it ([TextInput.setInputControl]) and
/// builds the editing state in Dart instead, from the key events the GUI
/// already forwards — each carrying the character the host's keyboard layout
/// resolved it to.
///
/// It owns two things, and the second is the one that surprises: insertion,
/// and the **editing commands**. On Apple platforms the framework refuses to
/// act on backspace, delete, the arrows, home, end and page while a field is
/// focused, and waits for the platform to name the command instead — see
/// [_selectorFor]. So a guest doing only insertion gets a field that can be
/// typed into and never corrected.
///
/// The chords stay the framework's: ⌘A, ⌘C, ⌘Z and the rest are not disabled,
/// and resolve as ordinary shortcuts once the panel forwards them — see
/// `isReservedAppChord` on the host side, which decides what a demo is
/// allowed to hear.
///
/// What stays missing is composition: dead keys (⌥e → é) and CJK need a real
/// IME, which means proxying the host's, which is not built.
