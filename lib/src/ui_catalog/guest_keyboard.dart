/// Delivers the guest's key events, which the framework otherwise parks
/// forever.
///
/// **Without this no key reaches a demo at all** — not a shortcut, not an
/// arrow, not a character. The reason is a handshake our embedder cannot take
/// part in. `KeyEventManager.handleKeyData` receives what
/// `FlutterEngineSendKeyEvent` sends, infers from that first event that it is
/// talking to a `keyDataThenRawKeyData` embedder, and then *queues* every
/// event instead of dispatching it — because a platform embedder always
/// follows its key data with a legacy `flutter/keyevent` platform message,
/// and that message is what flushes the queue. The guest's host is a few
/// hundred lines of C with no platform channels, so the flush never comes and
/// the queue only grows.
///
/// Rather than have the C host fake a macOS raw-key JSON message — feeding a
/// path the framework has deprecated, in a keymap-specific format, to reach a
/// `RawKeyboard` whose state would then have to be kept consistent — this
/// replaces `onKeyData` and dispatches to both destinations the flush would
/// have reached: [HardwareKeyboard], which owns the pressed-key state and the
/// handler list, and `keyMessageHandler`, which is where `FocusManager` sits
/// and therefore how `Focus.onKeyEvent`, `Shortcuts` and a text field's own
/// editing keys are reached.

  /// synthesizing the missing events; here the repair is to drop the event
