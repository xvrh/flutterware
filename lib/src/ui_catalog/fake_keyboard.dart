/// and a QWERTY keyboard — and they are precisely the keys that say *which*
/// keyboard it is. Leaving those blank is what made an email keyboard and a
/// text one tell apart only by the width of a space bar.
///
/// Every label is ASCII, deliberately: a glyph the rendering font does not
/// carry comes out as a tofu box, which is worse than the blank key it
/// replaced. That is why the backspace on the keypad is drawn as a shape
/// rather than as `⌫`.

/// Shared by both lanes on purpose — the guest drives it from a
