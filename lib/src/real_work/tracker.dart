/// Work that finishes on the **real** event loop, announced so a scenario's
/// next verb waits for it instead of guessing.
///
/// A scenario runs under fake time, where a settle follows frames and nothing
/// else. Work that resolves on the real event loop — a file read, a model
/// import, a decode on an engine thread, an isolate — schedules no frame while
/// it is in flight, so the tree looks finished and the step photographs a
/// placeholder. The harness lands the two kinds of such work it can see for
/// itself (a pending `ImageProvider`, an asset read through the scenario's
/// bundle) and spends a dozen turns of the real loop *guessing* at the rest —
/// enough for an SVG, nowhere near enough for a 6 MB import.
///
/// This is the third counter, and the only one the app fills in. Hand the
/// future here and every verb that follows waits, in real milliseconds, until
/// it has completed — then pumps, so whatever it set state on is drawn before
/// the step is judged or photographed:
///
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// void initState() {
///   super.initState();
///   _model = RealWork.track(_loadModel(), label: 'scene model');
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Outside a scenario it is a set insert, a listener on the future and a set
/// remove: no zone, no timer, no stack trace — that is captured only once a
/// scenario has started in the process, because only a scenario's deadline
/// ever reads it. A future tracked by one scenario is forgotten when the next
/// begins, so a load that never finished cannot hold every later scenario
/// hostage.
///
/// There is deliberately no counter-registration form. A process-wide counter
/// cannot be reset between scenarios by anything but the app, and a count left
/// non-zero by one scenario would be waited on by every scenario after it —
/// the shape the image cache already bit with. A counter is easy to turn into
/// a future: complete one when it reaches zero, and track that.
