/// A panel that renders its own widgets is invisible here by construction —

/// rendered by the cockpit, by `fw` and by MCP from one description, and by
/// the in-app overlay from the same one, so the two surfaces cannot drift.
///
/// **Almost none of this vocabulary is new, and that is deliberate.** Commands
/// are [PluginAction] — the same objects a host-side flutterware plugin
/// declares, already rendered as a form by the GUI, as flags by `fw` and as a
/// schema by MCP. Knobs are [KnobDescriptor] — the same objects the ui_catalog
/// guest reports for a demo's parameters, already rendered by a panel that
/// switches on [KnobKind]. What is added here is the two shapes neither
/// covered: an append-only **feed**, and a **state** snapshot.
///
