/// The look of a rendered panel, in the published package, without the GUI's
/// design tokens.
///
/// Why this exists rather than `FwTokens` (owner, 2026-08-11: *"we don't
/// move the token, that doesn't make sense — inline them so it looks mostly
/// right on both sides"*). One renderer serves two hosts: the flutterware
/// cockpit, which has `FwTokens`, and the in-app devbar overlay inside
/// somebody else's app, which does not and never will. Moving the GUI's design
/// system into the published package to share a few widgets would make it
/// published API for every flutterware user.
///
/// So: **colours come from the ambient `Theme`** — both hosts have one, and
/// deriving from `ColorScheme` is what makes a panel look native in either —
/// and the **rhythm is inlined** from `app/lib/src/ui/design/`, the numbers
/// copied deliberately so the cockpit's new tabs sit on the same beat as the
/// panels beside them. The numbers are duplicated on purpose: a copy that
/// drifts by a pixel is a far smaller cost than a shared dependency in the
/// wrong direction.
