/// Whether the app is being rasterised into an image rather than onto the
/// screen, and the way to say so around a raster.
///
/// **An external `Texture` cannot be in that raster.** `toImage` — on a layer,
/// on a `RenderRepaintBoundary` — flattens the retained layer tree offscreen,
/// and an external texture is not in the layer tree: it is a handle the
/// platform compositor resolves at raster time, against a graphics context the
/// offscreen path does not have. What that costs depends on the host, and
/// neither answer is one to build on:
///
/// - **macOS** draws the texture's rectangle fully transparent, every sample,
///   zero alpha. `WindowCapture` exists because of it, and composites the
///   guest's own frame into the hole afterwards.
/// - **Linux**, on the pinned engine, **segfaults the whole application** on
///   the raster thread. The engine hands `LayerTree::Flatten` a null graphics
///   context by construction under Impeller, and the embedder's external
///   texture resolves against it without a null check — see
///   `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-linux-embedder-guest-findings.md`,
///   which has the disassembly and the two upstream faults.
///
/// So the texture comes out of the tree for the frame the raster photographs.
/// Nothing is lost: that rectangle has never carried the guest on either host,
/// and the picture that does is two captures composited.
///
/// **This is a workaround for an engine bug and should not outlive it.** When
/// `Flatten` gets a context, or the resolve gets its null check, this whole
/// file and the `GuestTexture` that watches it go away together and every
/// `Texture` goes back to being written plainly.
