/// What connects a mounted [Devbar] to the channels a host reads.
///
/// The devbar is the *plugin host* — where plugins are constructed, because
/// that is where the app author writes them (Decision 2). This is the other
/// half of that decision: when flutterware is watching, every descriptor-mode
/// plugin of every mounted devbar becomes a panel, and stops being one when the
/// devbar unmounts.
///
/// **Nothing here runs outside flutterware.** Mirroring is gated on
/// [GuestChannels.installed], so an app carrying a devbar for its own sake —
/// a tester's build, a phone in someone's hand — pays nothing and keeps the
/// overlay as its only surface.
