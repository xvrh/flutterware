/// **The app owns the list** (owner, 2026-08-11: *"only devbar can report the
/// available flags"*). A flag does not exist until the widget declaring it
/// builds, so what is reported here grows as somebody navigates — there is
/// nothing static to promise, and promising one would mean a cockpit list that
/// lies. What the host may do about that is [presetAction]: name a value for a
/// flag that has not appeared yet, and have it apply the instant one does.
