/// How a devbar plugin says it can be rendered from outside the app.
///
/// **Implementing this is what puts a plugin in descriptor mode** — there is no
/// enum and no flag. A plugin that implements it is mirrored to the cockpit,
/// `fw` and MCP, and (later) drawn in the overlay from the same declaration. A
/// plugin that does not implement it is widget mode: it draws its own tab with
/// its own widgets and is invisible to everything outside the app, which is
/// the escape hatch for anything the vocabulary cannot express.
///
/// One place to declare, one place to disagree — Decision 1 of
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-devbar-run-bridge-design.md`.
