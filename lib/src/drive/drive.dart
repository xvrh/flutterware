  ///
  /// - **`keyEventManager` is deprecated and is nonetheless the only door.**
  ///   Its replacement, `HardwareKeyboard.addHandler`, reaches `HardwareKeyboard`
  ///   listeners and stops there: `FocusManager` registers itself on
  ///   `keyEventManager.keyMessageHandler`, so nothing that goes around it ever
  ///   reaches `Shortcuts`, `Actions` or a focused `TextField`. A Flutter
  ///   release that removes these members takes this verb with it.
  /// - **The manager is called directly rather than through its channel.**
  ///   `handleRawKeyMessage` *is* the handler `ServicesBinding` puts on
  ///   `SystemChannels.keyEvent`, so this is the same code either way — but a
  ///   `channelBuffers.push` invokes it in the zone the listener was registered
  ///   in and answers back through that zone, which under a test binding's
  ///   `FakeAsync` never completes. Calling it here keeps the reply in the
  ///   caller's zone, and keeps `handled` observable in a widget test.
  /// - **The first keystroke of a run decides the process's transit mode.**
  ///   `KeyEventManager` latches onto whichever kind of message it sees first
  ///   and asserts on the other for the rest of the isolate's life. Sending the
  ///   `KeyData` first latches `keyDataThenRawKeyData` — which is what every
  ///   embedder Flutter currently ships does, so the human's own keyboard keeps
  ///   working. Sending only the raw message would latch the legacy mode and
