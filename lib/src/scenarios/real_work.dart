/// How many turns of the real event loop a caller spends **guessing** — see
/// [landRealWork].
///
/// Every turn nothing needs is paid for in full, because "nothing has landed
/// yet" and "nothing is coming" are the same observation. That is what sets the
/// number, and it was measured rather than picked: on the example scenario
/// suite a turn costs ~56µs, so the 41 of 48 steps with nothing pending paid
/// **678µs** each — against the ~48ms their capture costs — and the whole suite
/// paid **57ms of 2.29s**, 2.5%.
///
/// The other seven steps are what the ceiling is for. The deepest of them
/// needed **seven** turns before its frame appeared — an engine asset read is
/// the slow link, and `vector_graphics` then decodes, lays out and paints on
/// top of it. Twelve is that measured seven with room, and it is spent again
/// from zero every time a turn actually produces a frame, because a decode
/// arrives in links and a chain three links long is not three times the guess.
///
/// The one caller that cannot reset it is the unsettled branch of
/// [landRealWork], where a scheduled frame says nothing — there twelve bounds
/// the whole chain instead of each link.
const realWorkTurns = 12;

/// How long a caller waits for work it has been **told** is in flight.
///
/// Only ever reached by work that never completes at all — a read against an
/// endpoint nothing answers. A decode that finishes takes as long as it takes
/// and is waited for exactly that long, so this is a deadlock ceiling rather
/// than a budget, and hitting it is reported on the step rather than swallowed.
const realWorkWait = Duration(seconds: 1);

/// How often a wait looks again. Real milliseconds, because the thing being
/// waited for is a decode on an engine thread and the only thing that advances
/// it is the wall clock.
///
/// A polling interval, not the unit [realWorkWait] is spent in: a turn of the
/// real loop under `runAsync` costs a good deal more than the millisecond it
/// asks to sleep — measured at ~2.4ms — so counting turns charged 1ms for
/// something like 2.4, and a one-second ceiling took two and a half seconds to
/// reach. [RealWorkBudget] reads a stopwatch instead.
const _waitingTurn = Duration(milliseconds: 1);

/// Lets work that resolves on the **real** event loop land, and be drawn,
/// before a tree under fake time is judged or photographed.
///
/// A [Settle] policy follows frames, and that is all any of them can do —
/// `upTo` stops at the first frame the app does not ask for, `frames` counts
/// them, `elapse` advances a clock that real work does not read. So a decode
/// running on the real event loop is invisible to every one of them: it
/// schedules no frame while it is in flight, the tree looks finished, and
/// whatever reads it next reads a frame the tree is about to replace.
/// `vector_graphics` is how this was found — a scenario's artwork appeared one
/// step late in every flow that photographs each screen as it arrives — but
/// nothing about it is specific to SVG. Lottie, a PDF or thumbnail renderer, an
/// `ImageProvider` decoding off the fake clock and a `FutureBuilder` on a real
/// future are the same shape.
///
/// Some of that work announces itself, and the announced half is not
/// guesswork. Two counters say a decode is in flight without anyone taking a
/// turn to find out: `ImageCache.pendingImageCount`, which every
/// `ImageProvider` passes through — `Image.asset`, `Image.memory`,
/// `Image.network`, an `AssetImage` — and [ScenarioAssetBundle.readsInFlight],
/// which is every asset the app reads through the scenario's own bundle, so
/// `SvgPicture.asset` and `Lottie.asset` are in it too. While either is
/// non-zero this **waits**, in real milliseconds, until it is not. That is the
/// deterministic half: the wait ends when the work ends, on a fast machine and
/// a slow one alike, and a 780×609 PNG does not need a bigger number than an
/// 8×8 one — it needs the same condition, held for longer.
///
/// What is left over is guessed at, and a turn is the only detector there
/// is. A `FutureBuilder` on a real future announces nothing, so this takes a
/// turn of the real loop and reads what it did: a frame scheduled on a tree
/// that was quiet before it can only have been scheduled by work that just
/// landed. Then it draws that frame with the caller's own policy and looks
/// again — and gives the next link a full [realWorkTurns] again, because a
/// decode arrives in links: a read completes, the app builds, the build starts
/// the next read. `tester.runAsync` flushes the fake microtask queue as it
/// closes, which is why the continuation has run by the time
/// `hasScheduledFrame` is read here and has *not* run when it is read from
/// inside the turn.
///
/// Returns what the step should say about itself: `settled` as the caller's
/// policy left it, and `landed` — false only when [realWorkWait] ran out with a
/// counter still saying work was in flight. There is no such flag for the
/// guessed half, and there cannot be: not knowing whether anything is coming is
/// the whole reason those turns are spent.
///
/// What none of it buys is work that needs real *time* — an http call, a
/// `Future.delayed` on the real clock — which no counter names and which
/// `s.runAsync` is the verb for.
///
/// A tree that never stops asking for frames takes the same turns, spent
/// flat. The loop below reads "a frame was scheduled" as progress and hands
/// the next link a full budget again — which is sound only while a quiet tree
/// is the baseline. On a screen holding an indefinite animation a frame is
/// always scheduled, whatever landed or did not, so that reading is worth
/// nothing there and the reset it drives would never end. Such a step gets
/// [realWorkTurns] turns with no reset instead, each drawn by a bare
/// `tester.pump()` rather than by the policy: re-applying it would spend fake
/// time the caller's policy declined to spend, and one pump at the same
/// instant draws what landed without moving the clock.
///
/// It is the weaker half of the two on purpose — flat turns bound the whole
/// chain rather than each link, so the depth it carries is [realWorkTurns]
/// links and not [realWorkTurns] per link (measured: twelve land, thirteen do
/// not, against the seven the deepest real decode needed). What it buys is
/// that a spinner, a ripple or any other indefinite animation no longer costs
/// a step its artwork — before this, *every* step reporting `settled: false`
/// skipped the landing altogether, the announced half included, and said
/// `landed: true` while doing it.
