/// The bundle a scenario reads its assets through: one that caches **values**,
/// never futures.
///
/// `rootBundle` is a [CachingAssetBundle], which memoizes the *future* of a
/// read. Under fake time that future belongs to the fake zone — it completes
/// when a pump flushes the fake microtask queue and at no other moment. Hand it
/// to `tester.runAsync`, where no pump can run, and the scenario stops dead:
/// no error, no output, until something far away times out.
///
/// Neither half of that is exotic. A screen showing an SVG puts the key in the
/// cache; a later step reading the same SVG inside `runAsync` is what the
/// blank-screen hint recommends. One screen and one step is the whole recipe.
///
/// So this caches what came back rather than the promise of it. A hit is a
/// [SynchronousFuture], which resolves in whichever zone awaits it and
/// schedules nothing; a miss inside `runAsync` starts its own read, on the real
/// event loop, and completes there. No future here can be completable by only
/// one zone.
///
/// The cost of that is the cache being useless until the first read *returns*:
/// callers that all ask before then each start their own read, where
/// [CachingAssetBundle] would have handed them one future. That is a few extra
/// platform reads in the first frame of a scenario, and it is the trade the
/// whole class is — sharing an in-flight read is exactly the thing that
/// deadlocks.
///
/// A scenario has one, reachable as `s.assets` and installed over the tree it
/// pumps, so anything reaching for `DefaultAssetBundle.of(context)` — an
/// `Image.asset`, an `AssetImage`, a `SvgPicture.asset` — is already reading
/// through it.
