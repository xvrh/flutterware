/// (`scenario('…', settle: …)`) and override it per call
/// (`s.tap(target, settle: Settle.none)`).
///
/// The default is [Settle.standard], and it is *bounded* on purpose:
/// `pumpAndSettle` never converges on a screen holding an indefinite animation
/// — a spinner, a shimmer, a looping Lottie — and throws
/// `pumpAndSettle timed out` when its ten fake minutes run out. A loading
/// spinner is the first thing most apps show, so the default must survive one:
/// it gives up quietly, captures the frame, and records `settled: false` on
/// the step. Use [Settle.full] where a screen that never settles should be an
/// error.
///
/// Frames are all a policy can follow, and a scenario needs one more thing.
/// Work that resolves on the *real* event loop — an asset read from the engine,
/// and the `vector_graphics`, Lottie or `ImageProvider` decode on the other end
/// of it — schedules no frame while it is in flight, so no policy here can wait
/// for it: `upTo` and `frames` see a quiet tree and `elapse` advances a clock
/// that real work does not read. Landing that work is a separate step a verb
/// takes after this one, deliberately not a policy: it is not a choice an
/// author makes, and a policy applied by hand through [apply] — as a plain
/// widget test does — should keep meaning exactly what it says. What a policy
/// does take is the [apply] hook that *waits* for such work between its own
/// frames, because a landing that only happens afterwards fills in the last
/// frame and leaves every earlier one with a hole in it.
///
/// This is also the one place a run records **motion**: a policy that owns its
/// pump loop hands every frame to the [ScenarioMotionRecorder] a run passes,
/// and pumps at that recorder's finer interval while it does. One seam, and
/// no verb had to learn anything.
