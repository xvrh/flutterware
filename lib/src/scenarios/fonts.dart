/// That lane's tester runs with `--use-test-fonts`, hardcoded, so a family
/// nobody loads real bytes for draws every glyph as a filled box *and
/// measures it at the box's width* — [loadScenarioFonts] closes that for the
/// families the project bundles, and this closes it for the defaults, which
/// ship with the platform and are in no `FontManifest.json`. Measured: a
/// default-family label went from 213.8 to 111.6 logical pixels when real
/// bytes took over.

/// (`$FLUTTER_ROOT/bin/cache/artifacts/material_fonts`), so nothing ships in
/// the package. The Apple and Windows default families get the same Roboto —
/// approximate metrics, against the box font's roughly double ones — so a
/// pixel-exact question about an iOS profile still belongs to the flutterware
/// runner, whose tester has no test-font flag and renders the real thing.
///

/// its own `Roboto` means it. Quietly a no-op where the cache is not there —
/// this is best-effort repair of a lane whose fonts the SDK took away, not a
/// contract the suite depends on.
