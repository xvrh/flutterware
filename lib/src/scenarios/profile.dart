/// ```
///

///
/// [keyboard] is the folder's software-keyboard policy, and it is **on**: a
/// scenario that taps a text field raises a keyboard exactly as a phone does,
/// so the layout is seen meeting the smaller screen and the shots are pictures
/// a phone could have taken. See [scenarioAmbientKeyboard] for what turning it
/// off restores and why a suite adopting this sees its pictures move once.
///

/// stubbed fails with a message naming itself rather than hanging. A folder
/// whose scenarios are worth pointing at a real service says so once:

///     runScenarios(testMain, network: ScenarioNetwork.live);
/// ```
///

/// that named one — `--network=live`, or `FW_NETWORK=live` in the bare
/// `flutter test` lane.
///

/// step `flutter test` otherwise leaves to each project's own
