/// The point of the whole thing. A scenario taps a field and photographs a
/// screen no phone would ever show: 844 points tall, with a form the user is
/// halfway through typing into. Everything a layout gets wrong about the other
/// 508 is invisible in every tool we have. With this on, a flow that fills a
/// form is a flow a phone could have performed, and its shots are pictures a
/// phone could have taken.
///
/// No heuristics, because the framework already knows. An `EditableText`
/// that takes focus asks the platform for a keyboard, and the test binding's
/// stub records the ask — so [TestTextInput.isVisible] *is* the signal, with
/// no cooperation from the app and nothing to guess at. The design's evidence
/// and the SDK line numbers behind it are in
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-fake-keyboard-design.md`.
///
/// The numbers go on the view, not on a `MediaQuery`. A widget can only
/// tell the subtree beneath it; the view tells `MediaQuery.fromView`, which is
/// where every `MediaQuery` in the app ultimately comes from — including the
/// ones a nested `View`, a `MediaQuery.removePadding` or an overlay build for
/// themselves. That is also what a real embedder writes to, so the app cannot
/// tell the difference. The slab is a widget, because a picture has to be
