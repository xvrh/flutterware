/// What a scenario's http requests reach.
///
/// A scenario runs under fake time, and `flutter_test` answers every request
/// with an empty 400 — so an app that loads an avatar renders a blank box and
/// says nothing about why. This is the setting that decides what happens
/// instead, and it is said in the same places [Shots] is: the project's
/// `fw.network(...)`, a folder's `runScenarios(network: ...)`, one run's
/// `--network=`, one `scenario(network: ...)`.
///
/// **Nearest wins**, and those four are the ladder in order — so a run reaches
/// past a folder and the project, and a `scenario(network: ...)` reaches past
/// all three. A run flag is not a master switch: `--network=record` against a
/// scenario that states its own mode records nothing, and says so on stderr
/// rather than leaving an empty store to be discovered later.
///
/// Whatever the mode, a `s.network` stub always beats it — the mode governs
/// what happens to the requests the scenario did not state an answer for.
///
/// It lives in its own file, like [Shots], because the CLI reads it to
/// validate an argument and must not reach Flutter to do so, while the
/// funnel that acts on it is nothing but Flutter.

  /// throw away a flow's other twelve assertions, and a scenario that wants
  /// the picture says so with a stub, with [replay] or with [live]. That takes
  /// a filter to hold: an `Image.network` with no `errorBuilder` has no error
  /// listener of its own, so the throw reaches `FlutterError.reportError`,
  /// which in a test binding is what turns a test red — see the

  /// on screen, including the https ones that drew a blank frame and passed
