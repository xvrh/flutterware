/// produce artifacts* — "screenshot this entry", "run this suite", "give me the
/// widget tree". So an artifact is the return type of doing work, not a side
/// effect of it: the CLI prints [path], MCP returns an image block, the GUI
/// shows a thumbnail. One object, three renderings.
///
/// [address] is required. An artifact that cannot say what it is *of* is not
/// reproducible, and a screenshot without its resolved axes is exactly the
/// under-specification the entry model warned about.
