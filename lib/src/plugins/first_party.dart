  /// **The command has to say no when the stack is down, and a lister does

  /// stopped project — it succeeded at listing zero containers — so a probe
  /// declared that way reads `up` forever, and the panel is confidently green
  /// with no Bring-up button on it. The same goes for anything whose exit code

  /// `kubectl get pods`, `ls`. The question to ask of a candidate is not "does
  /// this tell me about the stack" but "does this fail when there is nothing
  /// there".

  /// Where the answer is only in the output, the emptiness has to be turned

  /// more than one platform is better off putting the check in a
  /// [StackRun.script] of its own — which is most of the work of earning a
  /// [Probe.json], and gets the service list and the *broken* state with it.
  ///
  /// **And a lister exits 0 over someone else's stack, too.** The example above
  /// is right about zero containers and still wrong in a worktree: `docker
  /// compose` resolves its project from the working directory, so a checkout
  /// that has never brought its own stack up reports `up` — describing the
  /// containers of the *main* checkout next door. Measured in exactly that
  /// shape: exit 0, eight containers, none of them the worktree's. This is the
  /// monorepo the plugin is aimed at, and the failure is silent and confident.
  ///

  /// before asking the tool anything — no `.env`, no compose project name, no
  /// stack, answer `down` without spawning docker at all. That is a
  /// [StackRun.script] again, and one more reason the useful ceiling is
  /// [Probe.json].
  ///
  /// What it cannot do is tell *down* from *broken*: a health check that fails
  /// because Docker Desktop is asleep exits non-zero exactly like one that
  /// fails because nothing is up, and reporting "down" there offers a Bring-up
