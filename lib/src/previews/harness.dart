  // **What each stage costs, measured on this repo's 154 previews.** Against a
  // median entry that takes 43ms to *render*, the picture is close to free and
  // the two things beside it are not:
  //
  //     tree.json                 9.07ms   — nine times the picture
  //     png encode, 1x           12.46ms      36kb
  //     png encode, 700px         7.77ms      27kb
  //     png encode, quarter       1.07ms       4kb
  //     raw, any ratio            0.11ms     152kb at quarter, 2444kb at 1x
  //
  // Which is the whole argument for both options. [tree] is 9ms nobody looking
  // at a picture wants. [format] trades about 8ms of encode for **38× less
  // disk** — a whole catalog is 4MB as PNG against 368MB as raw — so a store
  // that keeps thumbnails keeps them as PNG, and a comparison, which diffs
  // pixels and would decode straight back out, keeps raw. [pixelRatio] barely
  // moves the clock either way; it moves the bytes — as the square of itself,
  // which is why a 3× device is 9× the frame.
