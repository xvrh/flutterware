/// to the terminal that ran `dart run flutterware`.
///
/// None of it was reachable. `RemoteLogServer.start` was never called, and
/// neither `REMOTE_LOGGER_URL` nor `FW_REMOTE_LOGGER_URL` was ever set, so the
/// "no server reachable" fallback had quietly become the only implementation
/// there is. `2026-07-28-cli-adoption-story.md` deleted the transport when the
/// process chain moved to inherited stdio; this deletes the shape it left
/// behind.
///
/// One method, because there is exactly one caller shape: a `Logger.root`
/// listener. The verbs that used to be here — `printBox`, `startProgress`,
/// `printStatus` — were terminal verbs on a process that has no terminal, and
/// the last of them is what put the GUI's welcome banner on screen as
/// `[$message - $title]`.
