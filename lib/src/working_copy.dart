/// second time. Everything a build leaves behind to make the next one
/// incremental is therefore dead the moment the first one succeeds — and it is
/// most of the copy. Measured on this machine: a built copy is ~1500 MB, of
/// which the product is 65 MB and the `fw` binary 17 MB. `FlutterMacOS
/// .framework.dSYM` alone is 501 MB of engine debug symbols, in a release
/// build, that nothing here symbolicates.
///
/// Two things are removed:
///
/// - **Everything beside [guiProduct]** within the platform build directory
///   that holds it. The freshness test both build sites use is
///   `DesktopGui.binary.existsSync()` — the product and nothing else — and a
///   release bundle is self-contained: its frameworks are embedded and its
///   rpaths are relative to the executable, so nothing outside it is
///   referenced. Trimming to it is measured at 1188 MB → 66 MB.
/// - **The Dart and Flutter build caches** — `app/.dart_tool/flutter_build` and
///   the workspace's `.dart_tool/hooks_runner`, ~265 MB together. Both are
///   inputs to a next build, not to running; `dart build cli` copies the build
///   assets it needs into its own bundle and `flutter build` embeds them in the
///   product. `.dart_tool/package_config.json` is deliberately **not** touched:
///   that is the resolution, and losing it would turn a warm run into a
///   `pub get`.
///
/// **Only ever a copy.** A checkout builds again constantly, and there the
/// incremental state is the whole point — the caller passes `editable` before
/// it gets here.
///
/// **Only ever after a build that worked**, and that takes two tests rather
/// than one.
///
/// [guiProduct] existing is the precondition for all of it, not just for the
/// pruning around it: a copy with no product is either mid-way through a first
/// build or holding the wreckage of one that failed, and that wreckage is what
/// the next attempt resumes from. It is asked here rather than left to each
/// caller so there is no way to reach the deletions without it.
///
/// The caller owes the other half — that no build *in this pass* failed — and
/// the two are not redundant. Observed: a GUI build that failed in the Dart
/// kernel step had **already staged a partial `.app`**, so the product was
/// there and the tree was not finished. Product-exists alone would have
/// reclaimed 1129 MB the retry was about to resume from.
///
/// The cost of that precondition is a copy that only ever built the CLI, which
/// keeps `hooks_runner` — 12 MB, and genuinely an input to the GUI build it has
/// not run yet.
///
/// Safe to call on every launch rather than only after a build: with nothing to
/// delete it is a handful of `listSync` calls, measured at 45–63 µs, and
/// calling it on the warm path is what reclaims the copies made before this
/// existed. It must be called under the same build lock as the build itself, so
/// it cannot delete intermediates from under another process's `flutter build`.
