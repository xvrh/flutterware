/// [captureSvg] and [capturePdf] replay a laid-out [RenderObject]'s paint
/// pass — no engine change, no compositing — into SVG or a single-page PDF;
/// [captureWidgetSvg]/[captureWidgetPdf]/[captureWidgetPng] mount a widget
/// offscreen first. Text stays text (or becomes glyph outlines read from

/// express follows [CaptureOptions.unsupported]: a raster patch, a flat

/// The server-side story starts here too: render points are declared as
/// typed values in a shared pure-Dart contract package

/// app binds implementations to them in a function marked
/// [RenderRegistry], receiving a [RenderHost].
