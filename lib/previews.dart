/// What a project writes beside its `@Preview`s: a shell, and knobs.
///
/// The annotation itself is **not here** — it is Flutter's, from
/// `package:flutter/widget_previews.dart`, and a preview that wants nothing
/// from this library does not import it. That is the point of the library
/// being small: the dependency is incremental, paid when you want a shell or a
/// knob rather than to declare a preview at all.
///
/// Deliberately small for the other reason too — this is published surface, and
/// every name here is a semver commitment. The machinery the flutterware GUI
/// drives inside the guest lives in `previews_guest.dart`, imported only by
/// generated code.
///
/// See also `ui_catalog.dart`, which is the *other* thing: a browsable page you
/// ship inside your own app, hosting these same previews.
