/// The catalog drawn as pictures, before there are any pictures.

/// What is under test is the **geometry**, which is the half that has to be
/// right before a single render is paid for: a full catalog is tens of seconds
/// of `flutter_tester`, so the sheet has to be a stable, readable page of
/// reserved boxes long before it is a page of photographs. Every tile here is
/// empty on purpose.
///
/// The two shapes a catalog holds are the reason the cells are uniform and the
/// boxes inside them are not — see [PreviewSheet]. A phone and a desktop panel
/// in one grid is the everyday case, not an edge one.
///
/// No Figma behind this; it is flutterware's own chrome.

/// The real thing: this repo's own catalog is 145 entries in 28 groups, which
/// is the size the whole design is for. A sheet that reads well at eight
/// entries and is a wall at a hundred and forty-five has not been tested.
