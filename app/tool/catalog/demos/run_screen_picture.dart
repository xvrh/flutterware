/// The run cockpit's picture pane, with the hovered node's box over it.
///
/// What this is for. The box is drawn by hovering a row in the tree beside
/// it, and a hover is the one thing the drive loop cannot produce — so in the
/// running studio there is no way to *look* at this at all without a hand on
/// the mouse. Here the highlight is a `ValueNotifier` set to a node id, which
/// is the same state a hover puts it in.
///
/// What there is to judge: whether a 1px accent stroke and an 18% fill read
/// against a screenshot of a real app rather than a flat colour, whether the
/// label sits where it can be read at a picture a third of the pane wide, and
/// what happens to a box on a node that reaches the picture's edge.
