/// The preview panel's own magnification capsule, in every state it takes.
///
/// **What this is for.** The control is a number and a cross in a 24pt capsule,
/// and everything worth deciding about it is a glyph or a pixel: whether the
/// dim state reads as *at rest* rather than as broken, whether the cross reads
/// as a way out at 11pt, whether the readout stops shoving the capsule about as
/// the number climbs from 1.4× to three digits. None of that survives a widget
/// test, which has no icon font, and none of it can be judged from the running
/// studio, where the capsule is 50px in the corner of a bar and every state
/// past the first needs a gesture to reach.
///
/// It is possible at all because the control takes values and callbacks rather
/// than a `CatalogSession` — see [ZoomControl].
