/// Two bars, and the difference is a claim. A render pass has a real count, so
/// its bar is determinate. A compile has no denominator and is not given a fake
/// one — a bar that fills at a rate nobody measured is a bar that lies, and the
/// climbing seconds beside it already do the one job it would be pretending to
/// do: telling slow from hung.
