/// A text's paint stack, in the shapes it is actually reached for.
///
/// Each of these is the same one list with different numbers in it — an
/// outline is a stroke beneath the fill, a sticker is stroke-stroke-fill, a
/// shadow is a blurred offset fill, an extrusion is a run of offset fills
/// under a gradient one. That combinatorial reach is the argument for a list
/// over a `shadows` property and a `stroke` property, which are two points in
/// it and do not compose (master plan §4.5). The last four are paint rather
/// than structure: a radial, a sweep, a gradient laid across each line of a
/// two-line title, and a gloss that fades to nothing so it sits on any colour.
///
/// It is a picture rather than a test because that is what it answers: does a
/// 14px stroke survive a tight counter, does an extrusion read as depth, is
/// the gradient measured against the box, the line or the glyph.
