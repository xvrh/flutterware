/// What a scenario's next link promises, drawn over the frame it acts on.
///
/// What this is for. In the running studio the mark exists only while a
/// pointer is parked on a next link, over whichever frame that run happened
/// to capture, at whatever size the window is — three variables to hold still
/// before a judgement about a stroke width means anything. Here the frame and
/// the size are fixed and the mark is always up.
///
/// What there is to judge, and the reason for two widths: the step page draws
/// the phone at about a quarter of its logical size, so every stroke here is
/// divided by four before anybody sees it. Does the ring survive that? Does
/// the white halo keep it off a coloured button, or does it just fog the
/// picture? And the tap case is deliberately the awkward one — `tap('Flat
/// white')` resolves the *word*, so the box is the label inside a row four
/// times its height, and the question is whether the pair reads as "here" or
/// as "the wrong thing is boxed".

/// value, and `scrollTo` and `keyboard` act on a whole region — so none of

/// replaces it survives the same quarter scale. Two things were measured to
/// fail here and are worth not re-inventing: a thin arrow across a pane
/// disappears at the small size, and `show` and `hide` become the same
/// picture if the only thing separating them is the wedge inside the band.
/// Hence a fill on one and a hollow on the other.
