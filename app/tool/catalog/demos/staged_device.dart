/// The preview panel's own device capsule — picker, rotation, frame — in every
/// state it takes, all at once.
///
/// **What this is for.** The control is three 24pt segments sharing one border,
/// and everything interesting about it is a pixel or a glyph: whether the
/// border survives the corner, whether the two icons beside each other read as
/// two different controls, what "dim" looks like next to "lit". None of that
/// can be judged from the running studio, where the capsule is 130px in a
/// corner of a window and every variant costs a device pick — and none of it
/// survives a widget test, which has no icon font and draws every glyph as a
/// box. Here they are side by side at whatever size you frame them.
///
/// The dependencies are the whole point of it being possible: an [Address] in a
/// [ValueNotifier] and a [CatalogStaging], both of which are constructible in a
/// line. Nothing needs a session, a guest or a shell.
