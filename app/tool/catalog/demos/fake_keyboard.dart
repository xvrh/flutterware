/// The fake keyboard's artwork — both platforms, both themes, at the heights
/// they are actually drawn at.
///
/// What this is for. The slab is a `CustomPainter` with no widgets in it,
/// so nothing about it can be asserted except by looking: whether the rows
/// read as rows, whether the modifier keys are distinguishable from the
/// letters, whether a 219-point landscape keyboard is still legible as one at
/// the size it is drawn. And it has to hold up at four combinations, which in
/// the running studio is four device picks and two theme switches away.
///
/// The heights are the measured ones — see
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-fake-keyboard-design.md`. Drawn against
/// the *widths* of the phones they were measured on, because the painter is
/// proportional to its box: an iPhone SE's 260 points over 375 is not the same
/// picture as an iPad's 405 over 1024.
