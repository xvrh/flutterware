/// Where the store's own listing goes on a set card — three candidates, and
/// the states each of them has to survive.
///
/// Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-store-live-and-upload-design.md`
/// §5. Nothing here is wired to a store; every screenshot is painted and every
/// live half is a literal, which is the point — the question is a layout
/// question and it is answerable without a credential.
///
/// Three things this is being judged on:
///
/// 1. **A project that does not use this lane must see no change at all.** The
///    first card of *Card states* is today's card, byte for byte, and it has
///    to still read as finished rather than as one waiting for a second half.
/// 2. **An absence somebody chose is an offer, not a warning.** Not declared,
///    never exported and never checked are all neutral; only a credential that
///    was found and refused is red.
/// 3. **A fact belongs at the level it is true at.** *Levels* is the check on
///    that: nothing about an account may end up printed once per card.
