/// whole purpose is that a panel, a `fw` command and an agent lean on one
/// process: a single malformed line from one of them would take down the other
/// two, and the surviving evidence would be a socket that stopped answering.
///
/// So the escape hatch is closed at the top rather than only at each call site.
/// The zone logs and keeps serving; the alternative — dying quietly — is the one
/// outcome a shared daemon cannot afford. Errors that genuinely make the daemon
