/// Drives a real catalog guest and checks that **the keyboard follows the
/// app**, rather than following whatever the host last said.
///
/// Not the measurement probe — that one is `tool/keyboard_probe.dart` at the
/// repo root, a Flutter app that runs on a simulator to find out how tall a
/// real keyboard is. This one takes those numbers as given and asks whether
/// the fake one behaves.
///
/// The transcript below is the contract, and every line of it is a thing a
/// screenshot cannot see:
///
/// - a demo that autofocuses a field is already asking for a keyboard before
///   anything has been touched;
/// - a **touch** outside the field on a phone-staged guest does not take it
///   away, because that is the phone rule and the whole reason PR 1 staged the
///   platform;
/// - the dismiss key does — and it does it by making the *app* let go, which
///   is why `requested` is what this asserts rather than `height`;
/// - a forced mode overrules the app without lying about what the app asked
///   for;
/// - a stage with no measurement raises nothing, however hard it is asked.
///
/// Written down because this repo has learned it the expensive way: a smoke
/// test that proves the guest survived a message proves nothing about arrival,
/// which is how keyboard *input* looked implemented for months while every key
/// sat in a framework queue.
///
/// Needs the previews in `examples/example/demo/input.dart`, whose first field
/// autofocuses — see `staging_probe.dart`, which shares this harness.
///
/// Usage: `dart run tool/embedder/fake_keyboard_probe.dart [projectRoot]`
