/// What a config reload does to a panel that stays mounted through it.
///
/// Saving `tool/flutterware.dart` throws the whole plugin graph away and builds
/// it again, so the panel's plugin — and the [PreviewsCore] and every
/// `CatalogSession` under it — is a different object afterwards. The shell
/// keys the panel on the worktree and the plugin *id*, neither of which moves,
/// so Flutter keeps this `State` across the swap. It therefore woke up holding
/// a session its owner had already disposed, went on rendering it, and the
/// entry list's `addListener` threw: *A CatalogSession was used after being
/// disposed*, three times, and a canvas that stayed blank until a hot restart.
///
/// Driven through [PreviewsPlugin.connectToDaemon], which is why that parameter
/// exists: the real connect compiles a snapshot and spawns a compiler, and a
/// panel that cannot be mounted cannot have its wiring tested. The connector
/// here never answers, which is enough — the bug is in what the panel *binds
/// to*, and binding happens long before a daemon says anything.
