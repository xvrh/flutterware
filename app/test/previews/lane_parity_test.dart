/// **The two backends, asked the same question.**
///
/// §9 of `2026-08-27-previews-render-lane-design.md` asks for this before
/// `screenshot` crosses, and the reason is a bug the last such check found:
/// the guest *audit* framed entries on `flutter_test`'s 800×600 where the
/// single-entry path gave 900×700, so one demo was reported overflowing by 576
/// pixels where it really overflowed by 476. Nothing else caught it, because
/// an audit row said which device an entry was framed as and never how wide it
/// actually came out. The check that would have caught it was deleted with
/// `captureAll`; this is its replacement.
///
/// **What is compared is the layout, not the pixels.** Two rasterizers on two
/// clocks will not agree byte for byte and are not supposed to: the guest
/// photographs whatever real instant its socket round-trip lands on. What must
/// agree is everything a caller *reasons* with — the surface the entry was
/// judged on, the boxes it laid out, and what it complained about — because
/// those are what make one lane's answer usable in place of the other's.
