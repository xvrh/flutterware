/// The tree selects, the sheet shows what was selected.

/// Two shapes were tried before this one and both were felt to be a mess. The
/// first had a heading on the sheet narrow the page to itself, invisibly, and
/// announce it with a filter icon — so it read as a filter having been applied
/// rather than as somewhere you had gone. The second dropped narrowing and made
/// a folder a *place on one long page*: the tree scrolled the sheet, the sheet
/// scrolled the tree's mark back, and a folder row folded and navigated from
/// one click. Nobody could tell what any gesture would do.
///
/// What is left is a sidebar and a content pane. A row picks what the pane
/// shows — one folder, or all of them — the chevron folds and does nothing
/// else, and nothing scrolls itself. The lost-your-place problem is solved by
/// the place being small: a folder is one screen.
