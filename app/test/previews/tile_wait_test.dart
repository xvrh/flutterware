/// A page of empty frames says nothing about whether the first picture is two
/// seconds away or forty, and the store has always known which — a cold harness
/// compiles the whole catalog and takes tens of seconds, where a warm one is a
/// message and a frame. These are the rules that put that on screen, and the
/// tiles are the whole of it: a counted strip over the top of them said the
/// same thing a second time, and went.
///
/// The no-spinner rule survives all of it. A shimmer is a surface treatment
/// rather than a control, so a hundred and fifty of them read as one page
/// loading where a hundred and fifty spinners read as a hundred and fifty
/// problems — and the queued tile, which is seconds away, gets no treatment at
/// all.
