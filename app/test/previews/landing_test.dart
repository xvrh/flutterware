/// What the panel looks like before a demo has been picked.
///
/// Opening Previews used to pick one: whichever entry sorted first by id, which
/// it compiled, revealed the folder around and wrote into the address. Two
/// things were wrong with it. The pick was arbitrary — entries sort by id and
/// the tree sorts folders first and then by label, so the demo that opened was
/// routinely not even the row at the top — and it made a link to the panel into
/// a link to a demo.
///
/// It is not the compile that was wrong. The guest still warms on the first
/// entry, because the cost is all in the boot: measured on this repo, a cold
/// start is ~12.5s and a switch on the warm guest is ~49ms. What was wrong is
/// calling that warm-up a selection.
