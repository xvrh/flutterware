/// The default was 900 × 700 — landscape, desktop-shaped — with no way through
/// it from the project. That is the bad kind of wrong: a phone screen laid out
/// in a 900-wide frame does not overflow and does not wrap, so the picture
/// looks fine and the bug you opened the preview to find is the one thing it
/// cannot show. Reported by a consumer whose catalog is 90 phone screens and
/// nothing else, who caught it because a human looked at the aspect ratio.
///
/// The precedence below is the whole of the fix, and it is the part worth
/// pinning: a project says what it is once, and every surface that renders
/// without being told agrees with it.
