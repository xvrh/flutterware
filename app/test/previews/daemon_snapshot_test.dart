/// Which SDK a daemon snapshot belongs to, and why the answer has to be in its
/// path.
///
/// The snapshot used to live at one constant path per install —
/// `<appPackageRoot>/build/catalog/daemon.dill` — invalidated by source mtime
/// alone. For a path dependency that is one checkout serving one project and
/// nothing can go wrong. For a hosted or git-pinned install it is
/// `~/.flutterware/<sha1(packageRoot)>/app/`, which is keyed on the
/// *flutterware* revision: every project on the machine pinning that revision
/// shares the directory, and each brings its own Flutter.
///
/// So two projects on two Flutter betas took turns bricking each other.
/// Whichever compiled the snapshot last owned it; the other one handed its own
/// Dart a kernel built by a different Dart, which the VM refuses —
/// `Can't load Kernel binary: Invalid SDK hash.` — before it can bind, so the
/// client polled a socket that would never appear for 30 seconds and then
/// blamed the socket. Permanently: the snapshot stayed newer than the sources,
/// which were never the problem. Deleting it fixed one project and broke the
/// other.
///
/// Pure unit tests — no SDK, no daemon, no compiler. The fixtures below are
/// directory layouts, because a layout is all [DartSdkIdentity.of] reads.

/// The prefix the VM's refusals share, as [DaemonLog]'s callers pass it.
