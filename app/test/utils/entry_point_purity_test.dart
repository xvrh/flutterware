/// closure, not of the package*. `flutterware_app` is a Flutter package that
/// also holds pure-Dart entry points, and the only thing keeping them pure is
/// that nobody adds the wrong import.
///
/// The stated guardrail is that `dart compile exe` fails. That is true but
/// late: it fires at distribution time, only for the entry points that get
/// compiled, and — as `2026-07-27-gui-slice-findings.md` records — the symptom
/// of getting this wrong was a compiler fork bomb that filled the machine in
/// seconds. This runs the same check in milliseconds, and prints the chain.
