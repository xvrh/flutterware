// A ring of three surfaces shared with the GUI process. The guest renders into
// one slot at a time; the GUI reads whichever slot FrameReady names.
//
// What a surface *is* differs per host, and that is the only thing that does.
// On macOS each slot is an IOSurface that also backs a Metal texture the engine
// renders into directly — zero-copy, no per-frame copy at all. Elsewhere each
// slot is a shared-memory mapping the engine's GL framebuffer is read back
// into: one copy per frame, measured at ~2ms for an 800x600 panel and ~4.5ms
// at 1600x1200. See
// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-linux-embedder-guest-findings.md`.
// The GL host cannot do better yet because a dmabuf is the only zero-copy way
// across a process boundary there, and exporting one is a Mesa extension that
// not every driver has.
//
// Everything above the two blocks at the bottom of this header is common, so
// `host.c` reallocates, captures, locks and advances the ring the same way on
// both.
