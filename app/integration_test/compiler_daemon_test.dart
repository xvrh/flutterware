/// The compiler daemon, as a real process, against this package's own demos.

/// Everything here is a claim about the daemon that only a running daemon can
/// answer: that it starts, that it drops an entry it cannot compile instead of
/// dying, that a second client attaches to the first one's warm compiler and
/// stays isolated from it, that an edit on disk is noticed, and that the set of
/// servable entries is announced to clients that did not ask. The unit tests in
/// `test/previews/` cover the wire format, the address, the depfile and the
/// client's own bookkeeping against a fake; none of them can see any of the
/// above, because in all of them there is no daemon.
///
/// **No guest.** Nothing here launches the embedder or renders a frame, and that
/// is deliberate: the guest composites through Metal, so a check that needs one
/// cannot block a CI run on a machine whose GPU situation nobody can promise.
/// Everything below stops at the kernel. What that gives up is real — hot reload
/// putting an edit on screen, knobs, axes, hover, view insets, the inspection
/// surface — and none of it is covered anywhere else. Restoring it means
/// deciding where a GPU can be relied on, not writing more assertions.
///
/// Not run by `flutter test`, which would want a device and
/// `package:integration_test` for anything under this directory:
