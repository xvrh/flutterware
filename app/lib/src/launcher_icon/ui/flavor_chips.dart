/// **These are icon sets, not the project's flavor list**, and the row says so

/// a `flutter_launcher_icons-<name>.yaml`, an `android/app/src/<name>/`, an
/// `AppIcon-<name>.appiconset` — and that spelling is `flutter_launcher_icons`'
/// convention rather than a rule of Gradle or Xcode. A project that writes the
/// wiring itself can point four product flavors at one `src/<name>/res` through
/// a `sourceSets` block and name every patient configuration's
/// `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME` at one catalog; then `<name>` is an
/// icon set that several flavors share and not a flavor anybody can build. The
/// real list lives in Gradle and in Xcode schemes, which is two parsers this
/// panel does not have — so it reports what it can prove, which is the files,
/// and every chip carries them in its tooltip rather than asserting more than
/// it read.
