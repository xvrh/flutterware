/// One side's replay of one scenario, filed by what made it.
///
/// The scenario twin of what [ShotCache] already is for previews, and inside
/// it: a replay is a pure function of the scenario's sources, its pixel
/// inputs, the SDK and the settings it ran under, which is exactly what a
/// `ShotKey` hashes. Filed that way, a base is replayed once per commit however
/// many branches compare against it, and a push whose inputs did not move
/// replays nothing at all.
///
/// Before this, nothing was filed. Measured on a consumer's second push with
/// identical inputs: previews came from the store in 8.5s where they had taken
/// 119s, and all 135 scenarios replayed again on both sides, for 262s — the
/// whole cost of a run with findings.
///
/// **One key per side, and the frames filed by what they are.** The list of
/// steps is filed under the side's key as `<key>.replay.json`; each frame is an
/// ordinary shot keyed by its own bytes, and each step's tree a shot keyed by
/// the step. Content-addressed because most of a scenario's frames are copies —
/// a step that changed nothing on screen, the same screen on both sides of a
/// comparison whose change did not reach it — and raw frames are a megabyte or
/// more each: filed per step, one 135-scenario suite came to more than the
/// whole store's size budget, and the sweep would have evicted the run it had
/// just filed. They share the store's sweep and so can be swept apart from the
/// list; [read] treats a list whose frames are gone as absent, and the side is
/// replayed.
