/// The previews of a checkout, as the runner asks about them.
///
/// One of these serves **both** sides: it is handed a checkout per call, so
/// base and head go through the same scanner, the same generated harness and
/// the same canvases. Two objects with two configs is how the two sides start
/// disagreeing about which directories to scan and which annotations count,
/// and then the comparison reports entries that only ever existed in the
/// asking.
///
/// Renders under `flutter_tester`, the audit's lane, not the embedder.
/// The embedder renders in real time, which is right for a panel somebody is
/// looking at and wrong here twice over: a catalog-wide render pays real
/// seconds per animating entry where fake clock costs microseconds, and a
/// real-time capture lands wherever the clock fell — the old lane had to
/// carry "still animating when it was captured, so this picture is not
/// reproducible" as a complaint. Under FakeAsync the same entry is
/// photographed at the same fake instant every run, which is the property a
/// pixel diff actually needs.
///
/// What the lane cannot do is talk to a network: `flutter_test` answers every
/// HTTP request with 400, so a preview of a remote image renders its error
/// state on both sides. The failure rides along as a complaint — identical on
/// both sides it cancels, like any complaint — but a real change to such a
/// preview's remote half is invisible in this lane.
