/// `pubspec.lock` used to be a pixel input like any other: one path, one
/// digest, folded into every entry's fingerprint. That is correct and blunt —
/// one changed byte anywhere in it re-renders and re-replays the whole
/// project. Measured on this repository against a base five commits back:
///
/// ```
/// 217 entries, 430 rendered, 0 skipped in 47060ms
///   because pubspec.lock differs — 168 entries
/// ```
///
/// In CI that is every dependency bump and every merge that touches a lock,
/// which is exactly where a comparison is most expensive and least useful.
///
/// So the lock is split. Each package's own entry is hashed on its own, and an
/// entry's fingerprint carries only the packages its closure **reaches** — see
/// `ImportGraph.packagesOf` and [ReachableLock]. A bump to a package nothing
/// in the entry names costs nothing; a bump to one it does costs exactly what
/// it always cost.
///
/// The bias is unchanged and the argument for it is the same: a package
/// wrongly included costs one render, a package wrongly left out reports a
/// regression as clean. So the reach is over-approximated at every step — both
/// branches of a conditional import, unused imports, packages named only in a
/// string, and then the whole transitive closure of what those depend on — and
/// anything this cannot answer falls back to [whole], which is the old
