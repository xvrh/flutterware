/// needs a session on both sides — which is a fact about the *runner*, and one
/// `fw compare` disproves by running with no session on the base at all. What a
/// comparison spans is not what a screen belongs to. The case that matters is
/// this work against its base, which is a fact about one worktree.
///
/// Files is free and the other two cost seconds, and that is why they are
/// tabs on one panel rather than a place of their own: behind a tab on the
/// screen you already open to read a diff, the expensive halves get discovered.
/// Somewhere else they would have to be remembered, and a feature that has to
/// be remembered is used twice.
///
/// Nothing runs on tab focus. Selecting a tab shows what the last run
/// concluded — kept on disk between sessions — and one explicit Compare press
/// per half is what starts the machinery. See [ComparisonController] for why
/// the auto-run was retired.
///
/// The file half renders without a session and these two cannot. It reads git;
/// they need the previews and scenarios cores, which need a resolved config. So
