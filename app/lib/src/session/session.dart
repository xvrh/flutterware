  ///   is how this CLI is driven while being worked on and has no launcher to
  ///   record anything. `bin/fw.dart` sits two directories below the package

  ///   `.mcp.json` uses — where `Platform.script` is a *snapshot* under
  ///   `.dart_tool/pub/bin/`, two directories above which is `.dart_tool` and
