/// - **The shell** contributes guards from [WorktreeFacts] — uncommitted work,
///   an agent mid-task, the primary checkout. These never run project code, so
///   they are there whether or not anything is open, which is what makes a
///   checklist for a closed worktree honest rather than empty.
