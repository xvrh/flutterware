/// itself moves whenever the daemon's own sources change, so *every edit to the
/// daemon leaves a fresh set behind*. Measured on one machine after three days
/// of development: 458 files, 227 locks, 214 logs, 14 orphaned sockets. None of
/// it large, all of it permanent, and `_tailLog` reads a whole log on every
/// failed connect.
///
/// `<key>.failed` is swept on the same rule. It is normally consumed by the
/// client waiting for it, but a client that had already connected hears the
/// failure over the socket and never reads the file — so it is orphaned exactly
/// when a daemon fails with a client attached.
///
/// Two rules, and the difference between them is what makes this safe to run
/// while other flutterware processes are up:
///
/// - **Nothing modified within [keepFor] is touched.** That is what protects
///   everything in use: a live daemon appends to its log, and a client that is
///   *this moment* deciding whether to spawn is holding a lock it just created.
///   It also leaves a post-mortem window — the log of a daemon that died an hour
///   ago is the only account of why.
/// - **Older than that, a daemon socket is deleted only if nothing answers it**,
///   and its log and lock only if its socket did not. A daemon can legitimately
///   run for days; unlinking its socket would leave it running and unreachable,
///   which is worse than the litter.
///
/// Guest sockets (`g-*`, `shot-*`, and the spikes) are aged out without a
/// connect test. Unlinking a unix socket does not disturb connections already
/// established on it, so the cost of being wrong about a guest is that nobody
/// new can reach it — and a guest that has been up for [keepFor] is a leak
/// rather than a guest. They are not probed because a guest's IPC socket expects a
/// protocol, not a knock.
///
/// Frame-scratch directories (`cap-*`) age out the same way. A session that
/// closes cleanly deletes its own; this catches the ones a crash left behind.
/// A directory's mtime moves with every file created or deleted inside it, and
/// a capture does both per frame, so a directory old enough to sweep belongs
/// to nothing.
///
/// `srv-*` sockets get the daemon rule rather than the guest rule. The guest
/// rationale inverts for an inspected server: a dev server running since
/// Monday is normal, and aging its socket out would cascade —
/// nothing new could connect, so the next attacher would delete its handle as
/// dead, and the server would vanish from every list while still running. The
/// knock is free by protocol: an inspected server writes nothing to a
/// connection that has not sent `meta/attach` (see
/// `lib/src/server/protocol.dart` in `package:flutterware`).
///
/// `live-*.json` is left alone: there is exactly one per project, so it is
/// bounded, and [attachToLiveSession] already deletes one that will not
/// connect. `srv-*.json` does not share that bound — one per server process,
/// under names that change — so an old one is swept with its socket, and kept
/// while its socket still answers.
///
/// `app-*.json` — a run's handle — is kept while its launcher is alive, and
/// aged out otherwise. It has no socket here to knock on: it points at a VM
/// service on a device, and deciding it properly means an async websocket
/// connect, which this sweeper is the wrong place for. The run plugin does that
/// probe continuously while anything is watching, so this only catches what a
/// crash left behind — hence the pid check, which spares a desktop session that
/// has legitimately been up since Monday, and the age gate, which spares a
/// launch that started thirty seconds ago.
///
/// `devices.json` is never swept: there is exactly one, it is small, and the
/// next daemon overwrites it. Deleting it would only make a cold `fw devices`
/// answer "nothing has ever looked" about a machine that had a device list a
/// minute ago.
///
/// Every failure is swallowed per file. This is housekeeping — another process
/// winning a race to delete the same orphan is the expected case, not an error,
/// and nothing here is worth failing a daemon start over.
///
/// [directory] defaults to [flutterwareRunDir] and exists so the rules can be
/// tested: what they turn on is a file's name and age, not where it sits, and
