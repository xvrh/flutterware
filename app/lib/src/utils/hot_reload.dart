/// Hot reload and hot restart of the flutterware GUI itself, from inside it.
///
/// Neither is a VM capability. The VM can swap sources, but producing the
/// new kernel is `flutter_tools`' job, so `flutter run` *registers* the two
/// operations as VM-service methods and any client may call them
/// (`packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/vmservice.dart` — `kReloadSourcesServiceName`,
/// `kHotRestartServiceName`, both aliased `Flutter Tools`). Its own comment
/// says why: a client uses the external service instead of the VM's internal
/// one, so it can invoke Flutter hot reload against an app started in hot mode.
///
/// Two consequences worth stating, because they decide what the UI may promise:
///
/// - **No `flutter run`, no reload.** A release build has no VM service at all,
///   and a debug build launched some other way has one with nothing registered.
///   [available] is false in both cases and the buttons do not appear.
/// - **The method names are namespaced per client** — `s0.reloadSources`, not
///   `reloadSources` — and the prefix is assigned by the VM. It cannot be
///   guessed; it arrives in `ServiceRegistered` events, which is why this
///   listens rather than calling a constant.
