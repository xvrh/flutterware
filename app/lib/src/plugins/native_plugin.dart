/// The GUI-side runtime of a native plugin — one instance per open worktree.
///
/// **A panel over a [PluginCore], and nothing more.** The core holds the
/// behaviour: the report, the actions, what `reload` does. This class exists
/// because `buildPanel` returns a `Widget` and a `Widget` cannot be linked into
/// `fw`.
///
/// **There is deliberately no `report` on this class.** Callers read
/// `plugin.core.report`. Dart cannot seal a member, so the only way to stop a
/// panel overriding the report — becoming a second, disagreeing answer to what
/// the sidebar shows — is not to give it one to override.
///
/// **A panel calls its core directly, and no panel invokes an action.**
/// `Session.invoke` has two callers, `fw` and MCP; a dialog that configures a
/// run, streams its output for tens of seconds and then offers to open the
/// result is not a shape that method can express — `JobEvent` has no log or
/// progress case, and `PluginCore.invoke` has no sink to report one through.
///
/// What the split does forbid is a capability that exists *only* here.
/// `web_build_dialog.dart` calls `core.buildWeb`, and `build-web` is a declared
/// action the other two surfaces reach on their own — which is also why that
/// dialog can print the equivalent command. A panel holding behaviour its core
/// does not have is the drift this arrangement exists to prevent.
