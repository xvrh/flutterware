/// How the run cockpit writes itself into an address, and how it reads itself
/// back out.
///
/// Both directions in one file, like `server_address.dart`: the address is
/// written by run chips and tab buttons, and read by the panel deciding what to
/// show. The round trip is the contract.
///
/// The shapes:
///
///     …/flutterware.run                  the runs, first one shown
///     …/flutterware.run/new              the page that starts one
///     …/flutterware.run/<key>            a run, on its screen
///     …/flutterware.run/<key>/screen     the same, said out loud
///     …/flutterware.run/<key>/tree       its widget tree
///     …/flutterware.run/<key>/logs       its output
///
/// **`<key>` is [runHandleKey] — `app-` and twelve hex characters.** It hashes
/// the worktree, the device and the entry point, which means it is *stable
/// across relaunch*: stop Staging on the iPhone, start it again, and the same
/// address still names it. That is the whole reason a run gets an address at
/// all. Nothing durable points at a single process, because a run is
/// ephemeral — what agents write down for the long term are journeys, and
/// those are deliberately last.
///
/// The tab list is open on purpose. `Screen`, `Tree` and `Logs` arrive with the
/// inspect slice; `Network` and `Data` are devbar plugins reporting into the
/// cockpit later. [RunViewKind.byName] answers null for a tab this build has
/// never heard of, and the panel falls back rather than throwing — an address
/// is a thing people type, and one from a newer build should degrade to the
/// run rather than to an error.
