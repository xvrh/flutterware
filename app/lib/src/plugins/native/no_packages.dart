/// What a plugin panel shows when the project declares no packages for it.
///
/// **Six panels say this, and said it six times.** Assets, Dependencies,
/// Launcher icon, Motion, Scenarios and Splash screen each carried their own
/// copy of the same two sentences, and the copies had already begun to drift:
/// four styled the text with `context.type.bodyMuted` and two with
/// `Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium`, which is a different grey for the
/// same sentence depending on which panel you happened to open.
///
/// It is a widget rather than six [EmptyState] calls because the message names
/// a file — `tool/flutterware.dart` — and a path that appears in six places is
/// a path that gets renamed in five.
///
/// The [icon] stays per-panel: which plugin you are looking at is the one thing
/// about this state that is not the same everywhere.
