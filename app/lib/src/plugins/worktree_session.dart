///
/// It wraps a session rather than being one. The two used to be parallel
/// implementations — same plugin list in the same order, same `reports`, same
/// lookup, one over panels and one over cores — and parallel implementations
/// of the same thing are how a GUI ends up able to do something no other
/// renderer can. Everything below the panels now comes from [session], so the
/// sidebar and `fw` cannot disagree, and [invoke] is the same single door the
/// CLI and MCP go through.
///
/// The unit of the open/close lifecycle. Closing a worktree disposes this,
/// which disposes every panel and then the session's cores — that is what makes
/// closing a tab release watchers and subscriptions rather than merely hide
/// them.

/// Worktrees that are known but not open have no session at all; anything the
/// switcher shows for them has to come from somewhere cheaper.
