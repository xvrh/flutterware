/// flutterware cannot reach, and whether that reader acted on it is not
/// something a clipboard write knows.

/// Hence [ExportResult.resolve], offered afterwards rather than assumed. It is
/// not the *Clear* button this feature has always refused: that one stood on
/// the screen as a way to empty a list, making *I dealt with these* and *I gave
/// up on these* one gesture. This one is bounded to the notes you just
