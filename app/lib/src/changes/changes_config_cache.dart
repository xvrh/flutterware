/// Where a worktree's `ChangesConfig` comes from when nothing is running it.
///
/// The config is *executed*, like every other config in flutterware. The
/// difficulty is that this screen has to rank a worktree that is **not open**,
/// and not opening it is exactly what "closed" means. So:
///
/// > **One writer, one reader.** Whatever executes `tool/flutterware.dart`
/// > writes the value it got, stamped with what it read it from. Everything
/// > that ranks — the screen, `fw changes`, an open worktree, a closed one —
/// > reads that one cache.
///
/// Which collapses the design's four cases into one code path, and makes the
/// first row of its table true by construction rather than by a second
/// mechanism: an open worktree is fresh because opening it is what wrote the
/// entry.
///
/// | situation | state | ranks by |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | open, or `fw` ran here | [ChangesConfigState.fresh] | the executed config |
/// | closed, config file unchanged | [ChangesConfigState.fresh] | the same value |
/// | closed, config file has moved | [ChangesConfigState.stale] | it, and says so |
/// | never opened, or no config file | [ChangesConfigState.none] | nothing — no rules exist |
///
/// Not written into the checkout, tempting as `.dart_tool/flutterware/` is
/// — the kernel cache is already there. A worktree's `.gitignore` is
/// *versioned*: switch to a branch that does not have the entry and a cache
/// written inside the checkout becomes an untracked row on the very screen it
/// feeds. That is the same trap `--untracked-files=normal` exists for.
///
/// Pure Dart — `fw changes` resolves the same way the GUI does.
