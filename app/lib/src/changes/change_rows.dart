/// The screen's two lists, each flattened to one row per drawable line.
///
/// An index and a body, never one list doing both. They used to be the
/// same list: file rows that expanded to inject their own diff between
/// themselves and the next file. That made the thing you navigate with and the
/// thing you read the same surface, and every complaint about this screen came
/// out of it — clicking a name scrolled instead of opening, a live re-index
/// moved the lines you were reading, and getting to the next file meant
/// scrolling through the last one's diff.
///
/// So [buildImportantRows] and [buildUntrackedDirectoryRows] are the left
/// column's two flat lists and [buildFileRows] is the right pane. The body
/// stays flat and virtualised for the same reason as before: a file is
/// thousands of diff lines, and only a flat list stays smooth at that size —
/// which needs every row addressable by index without building the ones above
/// it.
///
/// What makes that affordable is [HunkSpan.displayLines]: a hunk's header says
/// how many lines it will draw, so the row list is built from **metadata
/// alone** and the patch text is decoded only for the hunks actually on screen.
/// Scroll extents are therefore right before anything is read, and expanding a
/// file does not make the scrollbar jump as its content arrives.
///
/// Pure Dart — no widgets here, so the flattening is testable without pumping.
