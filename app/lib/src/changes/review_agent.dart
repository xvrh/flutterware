/// of a config file and asked whether the agent could read it. It could — by
/// knowing from a commit message that notes live in an append-only JSONL log,
/// guessing that *outside the repository* meant `~/.flutterware`, and searching
/// for a file whose name contained `review`. The note had been sitting unread
/// for a day. Notes were a shell feature rather than a plugin, so they appeared
/// in neither `flutterware_status` nor `flutterware_actions`, and a project that
/// declared three plugins got three plugins and no hint that a fourth kind of
/// thing existed.
///
/// So: one function that says *there are notes, and here is where*, on the call
/// every client is told to start with, and one that hands them over with ids to
/// answer them by.
///
/// Pure Dart. Both callers are compiled without Flutter — see the purity test
/// on the CLI entry point — which is also why [ReviewController] lives in its
/// own file rather than beside the store.
