/// shared [ViewerBundle] — data-free, it fetches its report at run time — so
/// it is built from the app package once and reused for every export after
/// that, comparison exports included. The **report** is the run the caller
/// just did, with every artifact copied in beside it and every path rewritten
/// to point at the copy.
///
/// So an export is: build the viewer if the build system says it is stale, copy
/// a few hundred kilobytes, and write one JSON file. The compile is the
/// exception rather than the cost.
///
/// The page must be **served**, not opened off the filesystem: it fetches
/// `report.json` and every artifact relative to itself, and a browser refuses
/// those on a `file://` page. `CatalogWebServer` is what the GUI and
/// `--serve` put in front of it.
