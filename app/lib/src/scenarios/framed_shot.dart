/// draws — hand-drawn where a body exists, generic where none does. It used to
/// keep its own named-body mapping here, which is how the same iPhone came to
/// wear a notch in the flow and a lozenge in previews. Desktop sizes and the
/// bare test surface get a plain border: a monitor body around a rectangle
/// explains nothing.
///
/// Over the screen, the **fake status bar** (time, network, battery) and the
/// home indicator, tinted by the `SystemUiOverlayStyle` the app declared at
/// capture time — dev_studio's trick, kept because a status bar of the wrong
/// brightness is a shipped bug a screenshot exists to catch. Drawn by
/// `StatusChrome`, which the store frame draws too: this was a copy of it
/// until the two disagreed about how big an Android clock is.
///
/// Reads the frame through the [ScenarioArtifactsScope] above it, which is
/// what lets the same widget draw a step off a worktree's disk in the panel
/// and off an HTTP server on the exported page.
