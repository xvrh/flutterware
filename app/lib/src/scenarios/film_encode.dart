/// Encodes a film **while the harness is still drawing it**.
///
/// The harness writes one raw frame per file, numbered without gaps and
/// renamed into place, and this reads them in order, feeds them to `ffmpeg`
/// and deletes each one behind it. That is the whole of the transport: no
/// protocol, no socket, and — the point — no moment at which the clip exists
/// on disk. A minute of film at 1080×2340 is 9GB of raw pixels, and the
/// consumer is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than the producer
/// (~3.5ms of `ffmpeg` against a build, a layout, a paint and two rasters),
/// so what is actually on disk at any moment is a handful of frames.
///
/// Three files agree on when it is over, and none of them is a message:
/// `film.head.json` appears with the first frame and says how big the frames
/// are, the frames appear in order, and `film.json` appears last and says how
/// many there were. A run that ends without the timeline ended badly, and this
/// aborts rather than handing back a clip that looks finished.
