/// Turning a capture into a PNG a store will take.
///
/// A scenario capture comes off `Image.toByteData(format: png)`, which is
/// always RGBA — 32-bit, with an alpha channel, whether or not a single pixel
/// in it is transparent. **Neither store takes it**: Play's asset rules ask for
/// "JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha)", and Apple's screenshot specifications say
/// no alpha channels or transparencies in as many words. So the debugging
/// lane's own artifact is the one thing a store lane may not ship as it stands,
/// and there is no listing anywhere that would have accepted it.
///
/// The debugging lane is left alone: `scenarios run` keeps its alpha, because
/// its artifact is read by an inspector rather than uploaded.

/// decoded buffer costs **16ms** — the blend spends all of it multiplying by an
/// alpha of 255. The detection rides along in the same pass, so nothing is paid
/// to find out which case this is, and a genuinely transparent pixel still
/// falls through to the blend rather than losing what is under it.
