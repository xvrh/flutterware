/// Where the next verb goes, drawn over the frame it acts on.
///
/// A scenario has no cursor, so a screenshot of a tap and a screenshot of a
/// screen sitting still are the same picture. Hovering a next link answers
/// the question the link's own label cannot — the label says `tap
/// "Cappuccino"`, this says *which* Cappuccino.
///
/// Three marks, not one, because the verbs make three different promises.
/// A pointer verb goes down at a point, and gets a ring. `enterText` touches
/// nothing at all — it focuses an editable and pushes a value — so it gets a
/// caret and a washed field and deliberately no finger. `scrollTo` and
/// `keyboard` act on a *region*: which pane, which way, and nothing about a
/// point. What decides is [verb], because the rect on a [ScenarioAim] means a
/// different thing for each.
///
/// Area over line, and that is measured. The step page draws a phone at
/// about a quarter of its logical size, so every stroke here is divided by
/// four before anybody sees it. A washed band survives that; a 2.5px arrow
/// across a pane does not, and neither does the difference between two marks
/// that differ only by the arrow inside them. So the region marks are told
/// apart by their fill.
///
/// Painted **inside a surface that is the app's own logical size**, like
/// [NodeHighlightPainter] and for the same reason: [ScenarioAim] is in the
/// view's logical pixels, so in that box there is no transform to apply and
/// whatever `FittedBox` or device frame sits above it is inherited.
