/// The scenarios plugin over a recording: the live core and the live panel,

/// What a recording holds per package is exactly what the core asks its two
/// doors for — the syntactic scan, the harness's listing, and the harness's
/// own report of each recorded file's run with every artifact copied in
/// beside it. The report is kept verbatim but for its artifact paths, which
/// the tool spells relative to the recording; [RecordedScenarioRunner] puts
/// them under [recordedProjectRoot] on the way out, so the core's own
/// relativising hands the panel a recording-relative path, and the panel's
/// artifact source — the recording itself — reads it. No path here ever
/// names a real directory.
///
/// Opening a scenario runs it, in the panel's model; over a recording that
/// "run" is a read, so the flow page fills in at once and every button on it
/// that would spawn something is honest about the one thing it cannot do.
