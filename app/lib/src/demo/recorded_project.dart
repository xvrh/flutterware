/// The project the studio opens when it is showing a recording rather than a
/// checkout: its own catalog demos of whole panels, its own scenario tests,

///
/// Everything the shell would learn from the machine is answered here instead
/// — the worktree list git would report, the manifest `tool/flutterware.dart`
/// would produce, the facts the explorer would probe — and every plugin's core
/// is either the live core over recorded readers (launcher icon, scenarios)
/// or a quiet [RecordedCore] whose panel says so. Nothing below runs a process, opens a
/// socket or walks a directory; the one filesystem touch left, the facts
/// store, points at a path that is not there and is built to shrug.
///
/// The recorded project is **`examples/brewline`, the demo app, as if it were
/// its own repository** — one package at `.`, which is what a reader's project
/// usually is and what keeps the workspace free of anything the disk would
/// have to confirm. See `tool/demo/record.dart` for how the recording is
