/// shaders a hook has just produced are unloadable and the library throws
/// before anything renders. Naming `metal` there is what makes them load;
/// elsewhere the default already is what the hook targeted, so nothing is
/// named and the engine's own choice stands.

/// This is also the line `flutter test` cannot cross: it offers
/// `--enable-impeller` and `--enable-flutter-gpu` but no `--impeller-backend`,
