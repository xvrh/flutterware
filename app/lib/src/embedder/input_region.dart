/// Everything a guest needs to be driven: keys, hover, pointers, scrolling and
/// trackpad gestures.
///
/// Coordinates and deltas are scaled because the wire speaks physical pixels:
/// the guest divides by its own ratio, so a wheel tick scrolls the same logical
/// distance whether the guest fills the panel or is staged as a phone.
///
/// **The ratio is read from the engine at event time, not passed in at build.**
/// It is the engine that was told what to render at, so it is the only value
/// that cannot disagree with what the guest is actually doing — and it moves
/// without this widget rebuilding, because magnifying the stage changes the
/// ratio and nothing else. Passed in, it goes stale the moment a zoom settles,
/// and a stale ratio does not fail loudly: every click simply lands somewhere
/// other than where it was aimed.
