///
/// **Deliberately not "every fact".** Only two things are worth persisting: an
/// answer that can never change, and an answer that cost a network round trip.
/// Everything else is cheaper to recompute than to invalidate correctly — dirty
/// state is ~25 ms per worktree and an agent probe is a `stat` — and a cache
/// that stores it would spend its life being wrong about it.
///
/// - **Branch diffs** are keyed by `<base sha>..<head sha>`. Two commits have
///   exactly one diff between them, forever, so the entry never needs
///   invalidating — it needs *evicting*, which is a different and much easier
///   problem.
/// - **Pull requests** are keyed by branch and stamped, because there is no
///   cheap key for "has the PR changed" and 890 ms is too long to pay on every
///   glance.
/// - **Changes configs** are keyed by the mtime and size of the worktree's
///   `tool/flutterware.dart`. Running that file is what "opening a worktree"
///   costs, and the changes screen has to rank a worktree **nobody has
///   opened** — so the executed value is remembered rather than approximated.
///   See the design doc's §5.
///
/// Lives outside the repository: this is machine state, and a cache written
/// into the checkout would turn up in the dirty count it is there to report.
///
/// **The file is shared by every process on this repository** — the file is
/// keyed by the repo root on purpose, and a Studio in one worktree plus a `fw`
/// in another are both writers. So a save is not "write my snapshot": it is
/// re-read, fold in what the others wrote since [open], overlay only what this
/// process itself learned, and rename into place — under a lock, so two saves
/// serialize instead of interleaving. Without that, whichever window touched
/// the file last silently reverted every other window's opened-clocks and
/// caches.
