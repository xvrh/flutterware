/// What each checkout's dev stack was last seen doing, read from the run dir.

/// **A file read, and only ever a file read.** Every other answer in this
/// screen is available for a checkout nobody has opened, because the shell
/// computes it — but a stack's state belongs to the *project*, and finding it
/// out means running the project's own probe. Doing that per row would spawn
/// one subprocess per worktree per refresh, which is exactly the cost the
/// explorer is designed never to pay.
///
/// So this reads the cache the panel writes: `stack-<hash>.json`, one per
/// worktree, updated whenever a session actually probes. That makes the column
/// a **ledger**, in the same sense as `devices.json` — a fact that happened,
/// which gets old rather than becoming wrong, and which is drawn with its age.
///
/// Two consequences worth stating plainly, because they look like bugs
/// otherwise:
///
/// - **A worktree you have never opened shows nothing**, even if it declares a
///   stack. Nothing has ever looked, and finding out would mean running its
///   config and its probe.
/// - **A reading can be out of date.** Someone tearing a stack down from a
///   terminal does not update a file flutterware writes. This is why the cell
///   dims past [freshFor] instead of asserting.
