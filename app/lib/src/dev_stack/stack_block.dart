/// The stack's state, as one widget with two forms.
///
/// **One widget, two homes.** The worktree home mounts the [DevStackForm.strip]
/// so "is my stack up" costs no navigation, and the panel mounts the
/// [DevStackForm.band] above its services, commands and console. Sharing the
/// widget is what stops the two from disagreeing — a second rendering of a state
/// machine is a second set of six states to keep right — so the forms differ
/// only in chrome. Every word and every colour comes from the same methods.
///
/// It owns the subscription: mounting starts polling, unmounting stops it. That
/// is why [DevStackCore.watch] is reference-counted rather than a one-way
/// `track()` — this is a subprocess every ten seconds, and a worktree nobody is
/// looking at should not pay for one.
///
/// ## The layout, and what it is answering
///
/// See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-dev-stack-ui-study.md` for the six
/// rules — one word one colour, answer before evidence, anatomical constancy,
/// the safe direction gets the weight — and
/// `2026-08-12-dev-stack-ui-study-2.md` for the pass that turned the card into
/// a strip. Two rules were added there:
///
/// - **The tint is the frame.** State was carried by a 3px rail against neutral
///   chrome, and the card existed mostly to give the rail an edge to be. A wash
///   of the state's own tone reads from across the desk and needs no card, so
///   142px of overview became 40.
/// - **A glance surface may only carry controls whose result is visible on it.**
///   The block used to promote the project's first argument-less command — in
///   practice `Logs` — to a link beside `Tear down`. Pressing it ran the command
///   and printed the output into the *panel*, a screen you were not on, so the
///   button read as doing nothing. Commands live in the panel now, next to the
///   console they write to.
