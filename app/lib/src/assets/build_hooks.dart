/// [failure] is a sentence, not an exception: a hook is a program a
/// *dependency* ships, and one that fails is closer to a compile error in that
/// dependency than to a broken catalog. Everything that did not need its output
/// still works, so the bundle is built either way and this is reported beside
/// it.
///
/// [nativeAssets] is what the `NativeAssetsManifest.json` the engine reads is
/// made of — the map the VM resolves `@Native` external functions through,
/// with a bundled library still pointing at the hook's own output file.
/// [AssetBundleBuilder] copies those into the bundle and writes the manifest
/// against the copies, so what a guest maps is never a file another tool
/// rewrites. Empty when nothing shipped native code, and always empty after a
/// [failure], because a mapping that names libraries a failed build may not
/// have produced is worse than one that says to look in the process.

/// Runs the `hook/build.dart` a project's dependencies ship, so the files they
/// produce exist before anything goes looking for them.
///
/// A package may generate part of itself at build time — `flutter_scene`
/// compiles its engine's shader bundles this way, and without them it throws
/// on the first frame. Nothing in flutterware ever ran those hooks, and a
/// preview of a 3D scene rendered anyway *because some other build had already
/// run them* and left the output in the shared pub cache. A clean checkout
/// rendered nothing, a developer who had run the app once rendered everything,
/// and neither could tell which they were.
///
/// **We ask for code assets for the machine we are on, and for no data
/// assets.** Each half of that is a decision:
///
/// - Code assets are what a scenario's own dependencies load —
///   `package:sqlite3` resolves `@Native` functions through the mapping this
///   run produces — and the tester lane is the one lane where nobody else
///   builds them: `flutter test` builds them before it spawns a tester, and
///   spawning the tester ourselves means doing the same. Shipping the empty
///   map instead does not even fail honestly, because the VM's process-lookup
///   fallback masks the gap on macOS and only there — the whole story is in
///   the design doc's piece 3. The target is the host, the way `flutter test`
///   builds for `TargetPlatform.tester`, because `flutter_tester` *is* a host
///   binary.
/// - No data assets is what `flutter_tools` does on beta and stable, where
///   `dartDataAssets` is not yet a feature. A well-behaved hook answers by
///   writing into its own package directory, which its pubspec declares as an
///   ordinary asset and [AssetBundleBuilder] already ships. Ask for data
///   assets instead and the same hook takes the other branch — output lands
///   beside the package unbundled, and we would have to key and copy every
///   file ourselves to keep what already works working.
///
/// No C compiler is named, deliberately: `flutter test` itself tolerates not
/// finding one for this target (`mustMatchAppBuild: false`), and a hook that
/// compiles C discovers the host toolchain the same way it does under a plain
/// `dart test`. A machine where that discovery fails gets the [failure]
/// sentence and the empty map — which is exactly what it got before this ran
/// hooks at all.
///
/// See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-build-hooks-in-the-bundle-design.md`
/// — this is its piece 3, built the day a real suite needed it; piece 2 (data
/// assets) still waits on the feature reaching beta.
///
/// Measured on a project that loads a `.glb`: **49.9s the first time on a
/// machine, 110–125ms after that**, and neither number is ours to improve —
/// `package:hooks_runner` caches the run, and the hook caches its own output
/// again inside it. Asking whether there is anything to run at all costs 30ms,
/// which is what a project with no hooks pays and all it pays. A hook that
/// compiles native code now genuinely compiles, and the same cache holds: it
/// is paid once per machine per resolution, not per bundle.
