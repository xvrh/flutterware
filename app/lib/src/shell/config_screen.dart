/// need the button until the import closure arrives with the resident compiler.

/// looks armed and is not should be turnable off to say so — but this line
/// already says what is armed, and the switch brought its own failure mode: a
/// fresh watcher takes the current file as its baseline, so every edit made
/// while it was off had to be caught up on re-enabling or be silently eaten.
