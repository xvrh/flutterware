/// The problem this solves: the studio and the app it is showing you are built
/// out of the same design system, and without a ground they run together —
/// same white, edges flush with the pane's own chrome, and a demo's `Reload`
/// button two pixels from a real one. The rule is that **the app is never the
/// pane's background**: there is always a ground, and the picture always has an
/// edge.
///
/// Previews arrived at this first and four other looks were built and
/// photographed against it — a dot grid, a checkerboard, print crop marks, and
/// the flush original. Nothing switches between them: the grid and the
/// checkerboard have nowhere to live where the ground is a 12px margin, and the
/// crop marks go invisible in dark against a ground that is *lighter* than the
/// pane.
///
/// It lives in the design system rather than in previews because the same
/// question is asked wherever the studio shows you somebody else's app — the
/// run cockpit's Screen tab asks it of a photograph. Two surfaces disagreeing
/// about how deep the ground is would read as two different greys rather than
/// as one convention.
