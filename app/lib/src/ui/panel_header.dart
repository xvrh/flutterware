/// Panels were each answering this independently, and the drift was measurable
/// rather than a matter of taste — three content gutters (8, 12 and 24 px) and
/// two title baselines four pixels apart, between panels that are otherwise the
/// same shape. One widget settles both, because the padding is no longer
