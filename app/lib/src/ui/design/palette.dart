  // Five steps, ranked rather than named for a job, which is the one thing
  // worth knowing about them: a call site picks by feel unless it is told what
  // each step is *for*. So it is told, below, from what the app actually does
  // with them rather than from a taxonomy invented afterwards.
  //
  // Deliberately not re-exposed under role names like `textSecondary`. The
  // palette already tried that during the `AppColors` migration and the
  // evidence is in: `mutedText`, `hairline` and `controlBackground` were added
  // as friendlier aliases and reached **zero** call sites between them. A
  // second vocabulary for the same five colours makes the "are these the same
  // grey?" question harder, not easier.
