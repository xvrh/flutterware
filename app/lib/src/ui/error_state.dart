/// The centred placeholder a list, table or panel shows when the thing it was
/// asked to do **failed**: a red icon, a [title] naming what failed, the
/// [message] the failure came with, and an optional retry.
///
/// The error arm of the load → empty/error triad, alongside [EmptyState] and
/// [LoadingState].
///
/// **It is [EmptyState] with different defaults, not a third layout.** That is
/// deliberate. The component this replaced — `ErrorPanel` — was a fourth
/// anatomy with raw `10.0`/`8.0` paddings, an uncoloured icon and text off
/// `Theme.of` rather than the tokens, and it had exactly one call site after
/// years in the tree. Panels did not adopt it because it did not look like the
/// panel around it. So the shape here is the shape a panel already shows when
/// it is empty or loading, and only the two things that genuinely differ are
/// changed:
///
/// - **The icon is red.** It is the one mark that separates "nothing here" from
///   "this did not work" without reading a word.
/// - **The message is selectable.** An error message is a path, a command or a
///   stack trace, and the first thing anyone does with one is paste it into a
///   terminal or a bug. An empty state's message is prose and nobody copies it.
///
/// Four panels had already worked this out and were writing
/// `EmptyState(icon: Icons.error_outline, …)` by hand; this is that, named, and
/// with the selectable message they were missing.
