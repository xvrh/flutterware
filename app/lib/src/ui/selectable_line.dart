/// One line of a multi-line block, so that a selection crossing it pastes back
/// as a line.
///
/// Two things are wrong with the obvious ways to make a list of lines
/// selectable, and this fixes both.
///
/// A [SelectableText] per line cannot be crossed at all: each one is its own
/// selection scope, so a drag stops at the line it started in. That is what the
/// run cockpit's log tab had, and "I can't select more than one line" is what it
/// looks like from outside.
///
/// One [SelectionArea] over the list crosses lines and then loses them.
/// Measured: four rows of `Text` selected and copied come back as
/// `line-2line-3line-4line-5`, run together, because nothing puts a separator
/// between two sibling [Text]s. A log you cannot paste is not much better than
/// a log you cannot select. The obvious repair — one joining
/// [SelectionContainer] over the whole list — does not work either: a
/// [Scrollable] under a [SelectionArea] installs a container of its own, so the
/// outer one is handed a single already-flattened child. The join has to happen
/// per line, which is what this is.
///
/// The terminator is conditional, and the condition is the one a terminal uses:
/// a line ends with a newline when the selection *reached its end*. Pick four
/// lines and you get four lines. Pick a path out of the middle of one and you
/// get the path — not the path and a line break, which would run as a command
/// the moment it was pasted into a shell.
///
/// A line with no text at all does not survive, and cannot be made to from
/// here: an empty [Text] reports no content, so the enclosing region skips the
/// container without ever asking it, and there is nothing to tell a blank line
/// inside the selection from a line outside it. Copying a stretch of a diff
/// therefore closes up its blank lines.
///
/// Wrapping is unaffected, which is the point of doing this per line rather
/// than per visual row: a line 208 characters long that wraps to eleven rows on
/// screen is still one [Text], so it copies as one line with no breaks
/// introduced at the wrap points. A line carrying its own newlines — a message
/// with a stack trace under it — keeps them.
