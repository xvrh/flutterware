/// A bordered button that runs something async and says what happened.
///
/// The problem it solves is that fast work is invisible. The splash panel's
/// Reload re-reads the config in about 40ms. Pressing it did exactly what it
/// promised and looked like it had done nothing at all — no press state that
/// outlasted the pointer, no result, no error if the read threw. The instinct is
/// to call that a missing spinner, but a spinner shown for 40ms is not a
/// spinner; it is one dropped frame. What was missing is an *acknowledgement*,
/// and an acknowledgement has to last long enough to be seen whether the work
/// took 40ms or four seconds.
///
/// So this holds each state for a minimum time rather than for its natural one:
///
/// - **running** — for at least [_minRunning], even if [onPressed] returns
///   sooner. Below about a quarter second a state change reads as a flicker.
/// - **done** — a tick for [_settle], then back to idle.
/// - **failed** — the error's own message, held until the next press. A failure
///   that timed out would go unread.
///
/// Re-entrant presses are dropped while running, so a double click cannot start
/// two of anything.
///
/// [onPressed] returning a `Future` is the entire contract: this catches what it
/// throws and shows it. A caller that swallows its own errors and hands back a
/// completed future gets a green tick for a failure, which is worse than the
/// button this replaces.
