/// The verb of an HTTP request, fixed-width and coloured.
///
/// Fixed-width because a column whose left edge moves per row is one the eye
/// cannot run down, and `GET`/`DELETE` differ by three characters. Both
/// request lists in the app used to glue the method to the path in one string,
/// so no two paths started at the same x.
///
/// Shared by the server panel's Requests tab and the run cockpit's Network
/// tab, which are the same wire seen from opposite ends and are meant to read
/// as siblings — the run tab's own doc comment says so, and saying so is not
/// enough to keep two copies in step.
