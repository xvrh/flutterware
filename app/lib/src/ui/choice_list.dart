// A single choice, made from a short list that is all on screen at once.
//
// [FwPicker] is the control for a choice out of many, or one whose options are
// not worth the room; this is for the other kind — two to five options where
// seeing them together *is* the explanation. The scene's "where does this go"
// is the case it was built for: a folder list of three where one row has a
// text field under it, which a dropdown cannot hold and a segmented control
// has no room for.
//
// The rows take [FwChoice], the same description [FwPicker] takes, so a list
// that outgrows the room becomes a picker by changing the widget.
