/// The centred placeholder a list, table or panel shows *while it is working*:
/// a muted spinner, a [title] and an optional [message]. The load arm of the
/// load → empty/error triad, alongside [EmptyState].
///
/// It is deliberately the same anatomy as [EmptyState] — same 32px slot,
/// same gaps, same two lines of type — so a panel that loads and then finds
/// nothing does not move its own words around as it settles. The two states are
/// the same sentence in two tenses, and they should look it.
///
/// The size matters. A bare `CircularProgressIndicator` in a panel-sized
/// field renders as a small dot floating in white with nothing to say — which
/// is what the previews panel showed for the several seconds it takes to build
/// a guest and compile an entry. A spinner the size of an icon, with a line of
/// text under it, is a state; a dot is a rendering artefact.
