/// row picks what the pane beside the tree shows, the chevron folds. A row that
/// did both meant one click with two results and no way to ask for either
/// alone. The catalog tree worked this out first and wrote it down; the asset
/// tree shipped the other way for a day and was wrong there for the same
/// reason. This is the one place it is now decided, which is the point of the
/// widget: the metrics are two ([TreeRowDensity]) because the trees really are
/// different sizes, and the *contract* is one because they are not different
/// controls.
///
/// The chevron is a smaller target than the whole row, which is the price of
/// the row meaning one thing. It is affordable because folding stopped being
/// how you look inside a folder — selecting it shows you, and the filter finds
/// by name — so what is left for the chevron is tidying a tree you are done
/// with.
///
/// [Tappable] rather than [InkWell], and not as a preference: these rows are
/// drawn on a panel's opaque fill, and Material ink paints *below* its child,
/// so an ink hover lands underneath the very thing it is meant to answer for.
/// A selected row hides it twice, having a fill of its own.
