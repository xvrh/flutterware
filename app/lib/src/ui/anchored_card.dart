/// A card beside a row, with an arrow pointing back at it.
///
/// **Beside the thing, rather than on the canvas.** The canvas is where a
/// *click* lands, so a hover that changed it read as a commitment nobody made
/// — and it is 500 pixels from the pointer, with nothing between the two to
/// connect them. This is at the hand, it points at the row it belongs to, and
/// it leaves what you actually chose alone.
///
/// Shared because the catalog and the asset inspector want the identical
/// thing: a card at a fixed width beside a list, vertically on its row where
/// the window allows and pushed inside it where it does not. What they put in
/// it is not the same at all — a rendered entry, a file off disk — which is
/// exactly the split: the geometry and the chrome here, the contents theirs.
///
/// [IgnorePointer] throughout, and not incidentally: the card exists because
/// the pointer is somewhere else, and a card that could be hovered would take
/// the pointer off the row that summoned it and close itself.
