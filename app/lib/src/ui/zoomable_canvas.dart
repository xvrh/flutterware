/// Flutter's own is not one. On macOS the embedder negates a wheel's delta and
/// hands a trackpad's pan through unnegated — correctly, because the framework
/// reads a pan as a finger drag — and then `InteractiveViewer` runs both
/// through the same `exp(-dy / factor)`. Measured, not deduced: the same `+20`
/// scrolls a list to 1020 down the wheel path and to 980 down the trackpad
/// path, and scales by 0.905 on both. So one gesture zooms in on a laptop and
/// out on a mouse.
///
/// One direction for both devices, and it is the browsers': **the gesture that
/// scrolls a page down zooms out**. That is Figma, Miro and every canvas in a
/// tab; macOS's own accessibility zoom is the other way, but nothing else a
/// designer touches all day is. The wheel already lands there, so what this
/// widget adds is the trackpad's ⌘ zoom, inverted from Flutter's. Pinch is
/// untouched — a spread is always larger, whatever the scroll does.
