/// Requests and SQL tabs, and the run cockpit's Network tab. Each of them had
/// its own `SizedBox(width: 380)` and a `VerticalDivider`, which is fine for
/// `GET /users` and much too narrow for a `select … where … order by …`.
/// [InspectSplitGrip] is what three other panes already use to answer that.

/// The width is remembered by the widget, not by the host: it is a thing about

/// would be persisting a preference nobody set.
