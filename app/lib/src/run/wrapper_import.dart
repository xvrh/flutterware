/// could reach it by path just as well, and must not: the app's own code names
/// it `package:$package/...`, and a library reached under two URIs is two
/// libraries, so a type crossing between them stops being the same type. Null
/// when [package] is unknown, because then there is no `package:` spelling to
/// write and the path is not allowed to stand in for it.
///
/// **Anything else inside the package is named by a path, and only that.** A
/// file outside `lib/` has no `package:` URI at all, so nothing else can name
/// it either and the double-identity hazard cannot arise. This is what lets an
/// entry point live in `demo/` — the constraint was always about `lib/` being
/// the half of a package that has two spellings, never about the wrapper
/// needing a `package:` URI specifically.
///
/// **Anything outside the package is dropped.** A path would spell it, but a
/// file in a sibling package is reached by `package:` URI from everywhere else
/// in the checkout, which is the hazard above with the packages swapped. An
/// absolute path is outside by the same test, which is why there is no separate
/// check for one.
///
/// **On web the path is dropped too**, and that is the compiler's rule rather
/// than ours — see [webWrapperImportRefusal].

/// its basename (`resident_web_runner.dart`, 3.47). The wrapper is the target
/// there, so the wrapper's directory becomes the root of the world and the
/// `../../../` that reaches the entry point on a disk climbs out of it — the
/// compile fails on generated source, reporting a file not found and an
/// undefined `main`.

/// would, and every directory the import could reach down from — the entry
/// point's own, the package root — is one the project commits. Rather than put

/// uninstrumented and says so. `lib/` is unaffected: a `package:` URI means no
