/// What a run looks like before it is one.
///
/// This is the state the cockpit spends the most user-visible time in and was
/// designed least for. It used to be a spinner, one word, and the launcher
/// log's *path* printed as selectable text under a doc comment claiming the
/// logs were being offered — so a consumer's first real launch showed one word
/// for ninety seconds while the tool wrote a page of narration into a file the
/// panel would not open.
///
/// Three things instead, in the order somebody asks for them:
///
/// * **Where it is**, from [LaunchLog.stage] — the tool's own words while a
///   progress span is open, and the milestone the log has passed when none is.
/// * **How long that has taken, against how long it usually takes.** A cold
///   build is allowed to be slow; what nobody can tell from a spinner is
///   whether *this* one has stopped being slow and started being stuck.
/// * **The log**, live, in the same [LogsTab] the run gets once it is up — so
///   `app.started` changes which tabs are open to you and nothing else.
