/// The picture, and the caption that goes with it.
///
/// The caption is tied to the decoded frame rather than to the bytes. It used
/// to be tied to `image != null`, and that misreported for as long as
/// the decode took: `Image.memory` resolves *asynchronously*, and a
/// `RenderImage` with nothing to draw yet takes `constraints.smallest` — zero,
/// under the loose constraints this column hands it. So the caption drew,
/// slid up to where the picture should have been, and described a picture that
/// was not on screen. Measured on macOS: 103ms against a painting app, and
/// unbounded against one that is not painting — a hidden or occluded window
/// schedules no frame, so the decoded picture had nothing to arrive on. That is
/// the state a Studio is in for the whole of an agent's drive session.
///
/// Handing it an already-decoded [ui.Image] removes the window rather than
/// narrowing it: there is no moment where this widget has bytes and no picture.
