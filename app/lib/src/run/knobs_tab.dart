/// The knobs of the run being shown, editable, with **Restart to apply**.
///
/// This is what makes the measurement reachable. The launch form lives on
/// the New run page, and the only route back to it is Stop — which is a
/// relaunch, which is the rebuild this design exists to remove. Editing here
/// costs a wrapper rewrite and a hot restart: 262ms on desktop, 3.07s on an
/// Android emulator.
///
/// The bar is pinned rather than last in the list. A knob is a short
/// list today and an app with eight of them is ordinary; a button that scrolls
/// away is a button you have to go and find, and the sentence beside it is the
/// cost of pressing it. Both belong where the decision is made.
///
/// Two things it deliberately does not do:
///
/// - **It does not restart on its own.** Losing the app's state because a field
///   was typed in is a surprise a cockpit should not spring, so the button is
///   the consent.
/// - **It does not apply live.** A value reaches the app only through `main`,
///   so showing a new one while the process holds the old would look correct
///   and be wrong. Until the restart lands, the edit is marked *pending*.
