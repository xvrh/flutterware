/// on every Android image, and `adb` is in the SDK every Flutter Android build
/// already needs. The Patrol-style automator APK — the heavier mechanism this
/// could have been — stays unbuilt because the cheap path passed its spike:
/// ~2.5s per dump idle, ~4s under a continuous animation, twelve dumps and no
/// failures, taps landing on the first try (S-N1, 2026-08-12).
///
/// Two measured facts shape everything here. **The dump arms Flutter's
/// semantics by itself** — UiAutomation registers as an accessibility service,
/// Flutter's `AccessibilityBridge` publishes, and the tree that comes back is
/// Flutter content *merged* with native views, without the guest being asked
/// anything. And **the dump, `input tap` and `screencap` all speak physical
/// pixels**, so there is no coordinate mapping in this file and none is
/// missing.
