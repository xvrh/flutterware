/// The platform's own log for one run — the half `flutter run` never shows.
///
/// **This exists because forwarding more of the launcher's output could not
/// fix it.** `flutter run` reads the device log itself and hands on a filtered
/// stream, and the filter is not about volume — it is structural. On an iOS
/// simulator the predicate it builds admits a line only if the sender is the
/// engine, `libswiftCore`, or the process's *own main executable*
/// (`processImageUUID == senderImageUUID`, `flutter_tools`
/// `ios/simulators.dart`). A plugin ships a framework, so it is a different
/// Mach-O image and can never satisfy that. On Android the mechanism differs
/// and the effect is the same: logcat is filtered against a tag allow-list
/// (`flutter*`, `DartVM`, `AndroidRuntime`, `System.err`, fatal), so a
/// plugin's `Log.d` — and the app's own — is dropped.
///
/// Measured on one simulator's log store, over a 12-hour window holding two
/// runs of an app whose push SDK ships as a framework: 1366 log events came
/// from the app's process, `flutter run`'s predicate admitted **7** of them,
/// and 105 of the 1359 it dropped were the SDK's own. That SDK's lines were
/// the entire evidence of whether the integration worked.
///
/// So the features whose behaviour is invisible in the widget tree — push,
/// purchases, deep links, maps, camera, Bluetooth, biometrics — are exactly
/// the features whose only instrument was unreadable from here.
///
/// **Scoped to the process is necessary and not sufficient.** The same window
/// unscoped is 385,000 events, and scoped to the app's process alone it is
/// still 1889 — `Network`, `UIKitCore`, `libxpc`, `CFNetwork` and the rest of
/// the OS talking on the app's behalf. One more clause, that the *sender* not
/// be an OS image, takes it to 141: the plugin frameworks, the engine, and the
/// app. That is the read this offers.
///
/// **A question asked afterwards, not a stream.** Like [readRunLog], and for
/// the same reason: the interesting lines are emitted in the first two seconds
/// of a launch, before any client could have attached. Both Apple platforms
/// answer from the log store with `log show --start`, so a run's whole life is
/// readable at any point in it — including after the app has died. Android's
/// buffer is the ring `logcat -d` dumps, which is the same shape with a
