/// in ordinary work: platform views (a webview's contents are pixels to
/// Flutter and a DOM to the platform), native dialogs — permission prompts
/// above all, which today dead-end a flow completely — the soft keyboard, and
/// on iOS an app the OS has suspended, which the drive layer can only
/// *describe* being stuck behind.
///
/// A driver is host-side by construction: it talks to the device the way the
/// platform's own tooling does (`adb`, the macOS accessibility API), so it
/// needs no guest, works on apps flutterware did not launch, and keeps working
/// when the Dart VM is not being scheduled at all.
///
/// **This layer is never taken silently.** It is slower and blunter than the
/// drive layer — a native observe is seconds where a Flutter observe is
/// milliseconds, and it addresses what the platform chose to publish rather
/// than what the app's code says. The caller asks for it by name (`layer:
/// native`); refusals on both layers teach when to switch. An automatic
/// downgrade would reintroduce the one failure this whole surface exists to
/// prevent — acting on something other than what was addressed, and reporting
/// success.
