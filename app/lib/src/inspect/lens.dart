/// It lives here rather than in the run plugin because the vocabulary is meant
/// to mean the same thing on a preview and on a scenario step — the same four
/// words, the same contents, one place to change them. Only `run` reads it
/// today; that is adoption pending, not a different design.

/// no picture. A preset is a default, and a default that overrode what the
