/// Extracted from the catalog's picker and the step page's, which had grown
/// the same ~40 lines apart. What differs between hosts is knowledge, not
/// grammar, so that is what the callbacks carry: how a point becomes a
/// highlight ([onSweep]) and how a click becomes a selection ([onPick]) — the
/// catalog commits through the guest's real hit test, a snapshot through its
/// rectangles. The run cockpit gets a picker for free the day it has rects.
