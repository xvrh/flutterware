/// What is wrong with a splash config, and how wrong.
///
/// Every rule here is checked against the generator's own source rather than
/// its README, and the two disagree often enough to matter. Two rules were
/// nearly written the other way round from what the package actually does:
///
/// - **A non-PNG source is fine.** The README's "PNG" reads like a
///   requirement; `_checkImageExists` accepts jpg, gif, bmp, tga and more, and
///   `_createImage` converts anything that is not already a PNG. So this
///   reports a conversion, not an error.
/// - **An unknown key is fatal.** It is not ignored and not warned about — the
///   generator prints and calls `exit(1)`, so one typo stops the whole run.
/// - **A missing `android_12.image` does not leave a bare colour.** This one was
///   written the wrong way round and shipped that way. When `android12ImagePath`
///   is null the generator *removes* `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` from the
///   launch theme (`android.dart`, `_applyAndroid12Styles`), and Android's
///   default for that attribute is the application's launcher icon. The package
///   says so itself, beside the call: `//create android 12 image if provided.
///   (otherwise uses launch icon)`. So the splash is the launcher icon on the
///   window background — which is both more alarming and more actionable than
///   "a bare colour", and is the "why is my app icon on my splash screen"
///   complaint everybody files.
///
/// [SplashProblem.blocksGeneration] marks the rules that stop `create` dead, so
/// a reader can tell "this will not build" from "this will look wrong".
///
/// **Every rule here names the edit; none of them makes it.** A problem is a
/// sentence with the key in it — "Set `branding_bottom_padding_ios` to at
/// least 34" — and the reader goes to the file. The buttons that used to write
/// those keys are gone with the rest of the editor: they were computed from a
/// transcription of somebody else's generator, and a wrong picture is a wrong
/// picture where a wrong button is a wrong edit to your project.
