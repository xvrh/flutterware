/// Whether the scan on screen is still the scan the disk would produce.
///
/// **Polled, not watched, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut.** The
/// reasons are specific to this plugin and are worth keeping next to the code,
/// because `ConfigWatcher` sits two directories away doing the opposite:
///
/// - **The set is not one file.** It is the config, *every image the config
///   references*, and the generated artifacts — around fifteen paths across four
///   directories. A designer re-exporting `logo.png` has to move the preview,
///   and a watch on the config alone would never see it.
/// - **`DirectoryWatcher` is recursive.** `ConfigWatcher` gets away with it
///   because `tool/` holds three files; pointing one at a package root would
///   walk `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, `android/` and `ios/`.
/// - **The budget is different.** `ConfigWatcher` feeds a compile-and-swap loop
///   that wants sub-100ms. A preview is fine at 750ms.
/// - **The scan already `stat`s all of it.** A fingerprint costs what the scan
///   costs to validate itself, which is nothing.
///
/// None of that makes polling reliable enough to be the only mechanism — a
/// network mount or a clock with one-second granularity can still hide an edit,
/// and a stale preview is indistinguishable from a correct one. Hence the manual
/// reload beside it, which is permanent rather than a fallback.
