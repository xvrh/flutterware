/// Apple's or Google's styling, so nothing here goes stale when either
/// restyles. It reads as a listing because of the *shape*: an icon and a name
/// over a row of screenshots that runs off the edge.
///
/// Which settles §12's first open question: **one arrangement, not one per
/// store.** Two chromes would be two invented layouts to keep current, and
/// they would differ only cosmetically — because we are not copying either
/// store, "App Store" and "Play" would be two of our own designs wearing
/// different labels. What genuinely differs, and what a person needs to see,
/// is *how many shots are visible and how much of each* — and that is
/// [StorePlacement], which is a question about the listing rather than about
/// the company.
