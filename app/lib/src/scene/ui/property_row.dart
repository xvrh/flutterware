// One property, one anatomy.
//
// The inspector's rows used to be hand-assembled: a caption, then whatever
// control the property needed, with the bound ones announced in a separate
// block at the top of the panel and nothing on the field itself. A reader
// could see that `fill` was bound and could see a colour picker, and had no
// way to know they were the same property — or that the picker they were
// about to drag would move a parameter every sibling reads.
//
// So a property row states its own origin, and the control it shows follows
// from it. A property is BOUND or it is FREE: bound, the control gives way to
// the source, because there is no local value to edit and a live control
// saying otherwise is the lie. A style is the one soft case — it sets a value
// the node may type over — and it stays live, marked.
//
// The plug is the affordance the panel had none of. It appears on hover on
// every bindable row, in the label's own line, and it is the same gesture on
// a number, a colour and a text.
