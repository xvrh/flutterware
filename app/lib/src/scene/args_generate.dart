// scene files. A scene file spells `const DrinkBadgeArgs(size: 140)`, whose
// class is written from the group's declaration of that widget, and
// `tokens.brand`, whose field is written from the libraries the group lists
// — so the declaration and the libraries are read, the classes are written,
// and only then does anything parse a scene.
