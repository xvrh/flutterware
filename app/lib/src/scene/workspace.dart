// The workspace: what the editor has open, and how you move through it.

// A scene FILE is one document — a scene class and the motions animating it
// (grammar 0.5) — so [SceneFile] holds the parsed pair, the editor state
// over it, and the save door. A [SceneWorkspace] holds the file you opened
// and the stack you drilled into: entering a nested scene switches the whole
// surface and leaves a breadcrumb, because an instance's internals are not
// addressable from its parent (the nesting law).
//
// Pure Dart, like the editor beside it: the fw CLI and a codemod open files
// through the same door the GUI does.
