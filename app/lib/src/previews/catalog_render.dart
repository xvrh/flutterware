/// projections of one observation, with the same inputs and the same

/// one question about a frame the others also had to produce. Three questions
/// was three renders, which for an agent in an edit loop is the dominant
/// per-iteration cost.
///
/// It also removes an assumption rather than only a cost. `screenshot
/// --annotate` read its own tree, so a caller that ran `tree` and then
/// `screenshot --annotate` got two trees from two processes; the ids on the
/// picture matched the ids in the tree because the build is deterministic, not
/// because they were the same object. Closing that loop was the entire point
/// of `--annotate`. One render, one tree, both projections off it.

/// compiled: a typo in a flag should cost nothing, and a compile-and-render is
