/// see `_installNativeAssets`: a native library must be an inode nothing but
/// this builder ever rewrites.)
///
/// An asset the project declared with `transformers:` is the project's own
/// case. A build runs the chain and ships the output under the declared key, so
/// linking the source resolves the key to bytes no app ever sees —
/// `AssetBundleBuilder` runs the same chain and links the output, content-cached
/// so an unchanged asset never pays twice. See [AssetTransformerRunner].
///
/// The other is the framework's
/// fragment shaders: the tool *compiles* those with `impellerc`, and
/// `FragmentProgram.fromAsset` parses the compiled bundle — handed the GLSL
/// source instead, it throws, which surfaces as a crash on the first tap of a
/// Material 3 button (the ink-sparkle ripple). They are compiled here by
/// [compileShader] and cached per engine revision and stage list, so only the
/// first build after an SDK update pays the ~250ms per shader. The invocation
/// is flutter_tools' `ShaderCompiler`, but for [shaderStages] rather than for
/// one target platform's — so the bytes are deliberately *not* the tool's, and
/// `tool/catalog/bundle_probe.dart` says so in those terms rather than
/// demanding they match. The project's own `flutter: shaders:` go the same
/// way, cached by content rather than by name — see [compileProjectShader].
///
/// In place, and never delete-and-recreate. The engine opens every asset
/// relative to a file descriptor of this directory, so replacing the

/// the 2026-07-30 mid-session spike as `Unable to load asset:
/// "AssetManifest.bin"` from a guest that kept innocently rendering its old
/// scene. A rebuild therefore updates the existing inode: manifests are
/// rewritten only when their bytes moved, links only when their target moved,
/// and whatever a previous build owned that this one does not is pruned.
/// `kernel_blob.bin` is the one entry the builder never owns — the daemon
/// puts it there, and deleting it would leave every attaching session a

///
