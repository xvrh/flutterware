/// Its own file for the reason [StagedDevice] gives: a control that cannot be
/// reached from outside `catalog_view.dart` cannot be put in the catalog, and
/// this one is a number and a cross where everything interesting is a glyph or
/// a pixel. `demos/zoom_control.dart` renders it in every state it takes.
///
/// Where it sits says what it is. The bar's own rule is that the device
/// capsule and the axis strip say what the guest *is*, and everything right of
/// the strip acts on the picture. Magnification acts on the picture — it
/// changes nothing the demo can see, not its size, not its layout — so it
/// belongs beside the capture button and not beside the phone.
///
/// A readout that is also the way out, rather than a readout beside a
/// button: the number is the only thing worth showing at rest, and at rest it
/// is dim and does nothing. There is no third state where you want to know the
/// magnification but not be able to leave it.
