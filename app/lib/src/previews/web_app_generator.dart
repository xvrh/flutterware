/// Writes a standalone Flutter app that browses the whole catalog, for
/// `flutter build web` to turn into a page.
///
/// The old catalog was a widget you put in your own `main.dart`, so building it
/// for the web was building your app. Entries are discovered now and rendered
/// one at a time into a guest engine, so there is no such app any more — this
/// writes one.
///
/// **It hosts the old [UICatalog] widget**, and that is not a stopgap. The
/// tree, the search, the device frames and the parameters panel all already
/// work against the model the new demos produce: a demo declares its knobs by
/// calling `context.knobs.*`, which is the same API the old
/// catalog reads, and `DetailView` owns an `EditableKnobs` and installs
/// the provider itself. Knobs travel over the VM service in the GUI only
/// because the panel is in another process; here the panel and the demo are one
/// isolate and there is no wire at all.
///
/// The axes carry over on the same terms, and for the same reason. Nothing
/// drove `CatalogAxes` here, so a `PreviewShell` declared its axes and then
/// answered with the defaults it had written — silently, because a bar that is
/// absent does not look broken the way a dead one would, so a page published
/// to be read in a second language quietly only ever showed the first.
/// `AxesControls` reads `describe()` and calls `apply` directly; the shell
/// already rebuilds on `CatalogAxes.revision` by itself.
