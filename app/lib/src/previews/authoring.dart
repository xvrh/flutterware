A preview is an ordinary function returning a Widget, annotated with Flutter's
own `@Preview`. Nothing of flutterware's is imported, and there is no map to
register it in — $scanned.

  // $example/buttons.dart
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  import 'package:flutter/widget_previews.dart';

  @Preview(name: 'Buttons')
  Widget buttons() => const Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(onPressed: null, child: Text('Elevated')),
          OutlinedButton(onPressed: null, child: Text('Outlined')),
        ],
      );

- The target must be callable with no arguments — a top-level function, a static
  method, or a constructor.
- `@Preview(group: 'Forms')` groups it; a file holding more than one entry
  derives a group from its own name.
- Two `@Preview`s on one declaration are two entries, which is how variants are
  spelled.
- An optional parameter is a knob you can turn from the panel, the CLI and an
  agent — `Widget buttons({String label = 'Hello'})`. So is
  `context.knobs.string('label', 'Hello')` read from a `BuildContext` inside the
  preview, which needs `package:flutterware/previews.dart`; nothing above it
  does.

`fw run previews new --name='Buttons'` writes that file for you.''';
