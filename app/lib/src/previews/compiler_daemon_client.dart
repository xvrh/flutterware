/// than three copies of it: a screenshot must not require a running GUI, and a
/// second consumer must not repeat the first one's work.

/// So [connect] connects before it considers spawning. Whoever arrives first
/// pays for the scan, the bundle, the host and the cold compile; everyone after
/// gets a compiler that already holds the whole catalog in memory.

/// spawns the compiler through `Platform.resolvedExecutable`, which inside a
/// Flutter app is the app binary, so compiling in-process relaunched the app
/// recursively. `FrontendServer` takes an explicit executable, so that class of
/// bug is gone and no longer the reason for anything here.)
