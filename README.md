# Flutterware

A set of tools for Flutter projects.

## Quick start

Add the `pub`dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`

`flutter pub add flutter_studio`

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_studio:
```

Run the GUI app

```shell
# Run this in your Flutter project directory
dart run flutter_studio app
```
The first launch is a bit slow because the tool need to be compiled.

- Hot-reload a test instantly (~1s) after any change
- Preview your app at any screen size and in all languages
- Easier to write tests that exercise the whole app
- Deploy the tests as a Web page for an internal documentation of the app.
