# Flutter Studio

A set of tools for Flutter projects.

## Quick start

Add the `pub`dependency
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_studio:
```

Run the GUI app
```shell
# Run this in your Flutter project directory
dart run flutter_studio app
```
The first launch is a bit slow because the tool need to be compiled.
