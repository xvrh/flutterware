// The example's build hook, for the third 3D probe (spec § 7.6): converts the
// glTF under `assets/` into `flutter_scene_generated/` at build time — the
// asset pipeline `dart run flutter_scene:init` sets up, written by hand so
// the probe's dependency is visible. `loadScene('assets/models/probe_rig.glb')`
// then reads the converted `.fsceneb` rather than parsing the glTF at run time.
