/// One of the app's own screenshots, by path — the seam a store scene injects
/// real pixels through.
///
/// A scene carries *data*, so the thing a scene can hold is a path; turning
/// that path into pixels is the app's business, which is what makes this an
/// external widget rather than a node kind. The path is a scene **parameter**,
/// so `StoreHero(shot: …)` is the whole of what injecting a screenshot takes,
/// and the editor still sees a real picture on the canvas while you place it.
///
/// **Why `Image.file` and nothing cleverer.** The harness lane waits on
/// `ImageCache.pendingImageCount` before it photographs anything (see
/// `landRealWork`), and every `ImageProvider` passes through that counter — so
/// a scenario, a preview screenshot and a `scene video` frame all wait for this
/// decode without being told to. The one lane that does not is the offscreen
/// render lane, which mounts and pumps once; see the note in
/// the design note (2026-09-09-store-assets-from-scenes.md § 2d).
