# Changes

What your branch changed, file by file, with the files that matter to your
project listed first. It's the studio's home for reviewing work before a pull
request, including work an agent did.

## Turn it on

The Changes screen is always there. What you can add is the list of files to
look at first:

```dart
// tool/flutterware.dart
fw.changes(
  ChangesConfig(
    attention: [
      'tool/flutterware.dart',
      'lib/*.dart',
      'pubspec.yaml',
      '.github/workflows/**',
      'CLAUDE.md',
    ],
  ),
);
```

The patterns follow `.gitignore` rules. Every file they match goes to the
**Important** tab, labelled with the pattern that put it there. There's no
built-in list, because only you know what matters in your repository.

Set `base:` if the branch to compare against isn't `origin/HEAD`, `main` or
`master`.

## In the studio

The screen compares your checkout with its base: committed changes, staged
and unstaged edits, and new files, all as one set. Pick a file to see its diff.
New files show their content, and changed images show both versions.

When `fw compare` has run, the screens your branch changed appear here too.
See [Comparison](comparison.md).

## Notes for an agent

While an agent works in your checkout, you can leave a note on any line of the
diff. The agent reads outstanding notes with `flutterware_review` over MCP,
does what they ask (or explains why not), and marks them resolved. Its answer
shows beside your note. `flutterware_status` tells the agent how many are
waiting, so it knows when to look.

From the command line:

```shell
fw changes                      # what this checkout changed, ranked
fw review                       # the outstanding notes
fw review resolve <id> --message='Done: renamed the field'
```

[`flutterware_review`](../docs/capabilities.md#flutterware_review) in the
capabilities reference.
