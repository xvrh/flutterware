# Previews

Look at a screen without running the app to get there. Previews renders every
`@Preview` in your project on a device frame, in a live Flutter engine, with
your fonts and your theme.

![The previews panel: the demo's screens listed on the left, the menu rendered
on an iPhone 16 frame on the right](screenshots/ui_catalog.png)

The live panel in the studio is macOS only for now. The command line actions
that render without a window, like `screenshot` and `audit`, also run on Linux.

## Write a preview

A preview is a function that returns a widget, marked with Flutter's own
`@Preview` annotation:

```dart
// demo/shop.dart
import 'package:flutter/widget_previews.dart';

@Preview(name: 'Menu', group: 'Shop', wrapper: wrapInShop)
Widget shopMenu() => const MenuScreen();

@Preview(name: 'Drink', group: 'Shop', wrapper: wrapInShop)
Widget shopDrink() => DrinkScreen(drinks.first);
```

Nothing from flutterware is needed to declare one, and there's no list to
register it in: every `.dart` file in the package is scanned. A preview written
for Flutter's own previewer shows up here unchanged.

`fw run previews new --name='Menu'` writes a starter file for you.

## Turn it on

```dart
// tool/flutterware.dart
fw.use(
  Previews(
    packages: [
      PreviewsPackage(
        app,
        directory: 'demo',
        canvases: [
          PreviewCanvas('', devices: [Devices.iphone16, Devices.androidTall]),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

- `directory` limits the scan to one folder. Leave it out to scan the whole
  package.
- A **canvas** says which devices a folder's previews are drawn on. The first
  device is the default, and the list is what the device picker offers. `''`
  covers the whole package; a path like `'demo/tablet'` covers one folder, and
  the longest match wins. Without a canvas a preview renders on a plain 900×700
  rectangle, which is rarely what a phone screen should be checked on.

## Give previews what the app would

A screen usually expects a `MaterialApp`, a theme and localizations above it.
The `wrapper:` of a preview puts them back. Wrap that in a `PreviewShell` and
you also get switches in the previews toolbar, which stay set as you move from
one preview to the next:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
import 'package:flutterware/previews.dart';

Widget wrapInShop(Widget child) => PreviewShell(
  'shop',
  builder: (context, axes) => MaterialApp(
    theme: shopTheme(
      axes.flag('dark', false) ? Brightness.dark : Brightness.light,
    ),
    locale: axes.picker('locale', {
      'English': const Locale('en'),
      'Français': const Locale('fr'),
    }, const Locale('en')),
    localizationsDelegates: [
      ShopStrings.delegate,
      ...GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegates,
    ],
    home: child,
  ),
);
```

Outside the studio, in your app or in Flutter's previewer, every axis returns
its default.

## Knobs

A knob is a value you can change while looking at a preview. Ask for one while
building:

```dart
@Preview(name: 'Order placed', group: 'Shop', wrapper: wrapInShop)
Widget shopConfirmation() => Builder(
  builder: (context) =>
      ConfirmationScreen(name: context.knobs.string('name', 'Ada')),
);
```

It appears in the **Controls** tab. A preview's optional parameters become knobs
too, so `Widget shopConfirmation({String name = 'Ada'})` declares the same one.
Outside the studio a knob returns the default written at the call site, so it's
safe to leave in code that ships.

## In the studio

Pick a preview in the list and it renders on the canvas's default device. The
toolbar changes the device, rotates it, raises the software keyboard and
zooms. The tabs underneath are:

- **Controls**: the preview's knobs. The shell's axes sit in the toolbar above.
- **Elements**: the widget tree, with each widget's box and properties.
- **Semantics**: what a screen reader gets.
- **Problems**: why the preview isn't working, starting with compile errors,
  then anything the framework reported while it rendered.
- **Console**: what the preview printed.

Save a file and the preview reloads.

## From the command line or an agent

```shell
fw run previews entries                                         # every preview, with its id
fw run previews screenshot --entry='demo/shop.dart#shopMenu'    # render one to a PNG
fw run previews screenshot --entry='demo/shop.dart#shopMenu' \
    --device=android-tall --axes='dark=true,locale=Français'
fw run previews inspect --entry='demo/shop.dart#shopMenu'       # what's on screen, as text
fw run previews audit                                           # render every preview, report failures
fw run previews build-web                                       # your previews as a web page
```

`screenshot` is the quickest way for an agent to check how a widget looks: it
renders with the real fonts and theme, at the device's pixel ratio, and
`--node=<name>` crops to one widget. Over MCP the same actions go through
`flutterware_invoke`.

## Check every preview in CI

`fw run previews audit` renders every preview on its canvas, reports each one
that doesn't compile or doesn't render, and exits non-zero if there is one. It
also writes an ordinary test file, so the same check can run with the rest of
your suite:

```shell
fw run previews audit
flutter test build/flutterware/previews_harness.dart
```

Expect the first audit to find things. A preview that only worked because
something above it provided a `Directionality` or a `MediaQuery` fails here and
nowhere else.
