# Translations

Every translation key in every language, and a picture of where each string
appears in your app. Translations also tells you which keys are missing in a
language, which the app never uses, and which are too long for the screen.

![The translations table: each key with a picture of the string on screen, its
English text and its French text, with two keys missing in French](screenshots/translations.png)

The pictures come from your [scenarios](scenarios.md): while they run,
flutterware records which key produced which words on which screen.

## Turn it on

```dart
// tool/flutterware.dart
fw.use(
  Translations(
    packages: [
      TranslationsPackage(
        app,
        catalogs: [
          TranslationCatalog(name: 'shop', files: 'assets/i18n/*.json'),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

A catalog is where your strings live. Two layouts are supported:

- **One file per language**, each a flat JSON object of key to text:
  `assets/i18n/en.json` holding `{"addToCart": "Add to cart"}`. The file name
  is the language. This is `TranslationCatalog(files: …)`.
- **One file with every language under each key**:
  `{"addToCart": {"en": "Add to cart", "fr": "Ajouter au panier"}}`. This is
  `TranslationCatalog.localesPerKey(file: …)`.

`template:` names the language your source text is written in (English by
default). A key missing from another language falls back to it, and the table
flags that.

The table and the missing-key count work from the files alone. The pictures
need one more step.

## Connect your strings to the screen

To know which key a piece of text came from, flutterware needs to see each
string as it leaves your catalog. Most apps already read every string through
one function, so the hook goes there:

```dart
class ShopStrings {
  ShopStrings(this._values, this._fallback);

  /// Null in the app. Scenario runs set it.
  static String Function(String key, String value)? wrapValue;

  final Map<String, String> _values;
  final Map<String, String> _fallback;

  String read(String key) {
    var value = _values[key] ?? _fallback[key] ?? '';
    return wrapValue?.call(key, value) ?? value;
  }
}
```

Then, in the `flutter_test_config.dart` of your scenario folder:

```dart
Future<void> testExecutable(FutureOr<void> Function() testMain) {
  ShopStrings.wrapValue = indexTranslations('shop');
  return runScenarios(testMain);
}
```

The name passed to `indexTranslations` is the catalog's `name:`. Nothing is
added to the text and no pixel moves: the string is matched by identity. In
the app the hook is null and costs nothing.

Two helpers cover the less common cases:

- `indexExpansions('shop')` for strings your catalog builds from a template,
  like `'Thanks, $name!'`.
- `indexTranslationsIn<MyMarkdown>((w) => w.data)` for a widget that draws
  text without a `Text` widget.

## Export for translators

```shell
fw run translations export
fw run translations export --languages=en,fr,de --device=iphone-16
fw run translations export --max-lengths=true
```

The export runs your scenarios and writes `build/translations/`: one
screenshot per screen, a `keys.json` saying where each key was seen (with its
box on the screenshot), and an `index.html` a translator can open. Nothing is
cropped or drawn on the pictures, so the same files can be pushed to a
translation service. `package:flutterware/translations.dart` reads
`keys.json` back, typed, for the script that does the push.

`--max-lengths=true` measures how long each string can get before it stops
fitting: it re-runs the suite with every string padded, on the narrowest device
your scenario folders declare, and records the longest length that still fit,
with a picture of where it broke.

The export exits non-zero when something is wrong, so it can gate a CI job.
