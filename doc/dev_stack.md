# Dev stack

The services your app needs while you work (a database, a local API, Docker
containers), with their state and a start and stop button, driven by the
commands your project already has.

## Turn it on

```dart
// tool/flutterware.dart
fw.use(
  DevStack.background(
    label: 'Local services',
    probe: Probe.exitCode(
      StackRun.command([
        'sh',
        '-c',
        r'test -n "$(docker compose ps --quiet --status running)"',
      ]),
    ),
    start: StackRun.command(['docker', 'compose', 'up', '-d']),
    stop: StackRun.command(['docker', 'compose', 'down']),
    commands: [
      StackCommand(
        'logs',
        'Logs',
        StackRun.command(['docker', 'compose', 'logs', '--tail=40']),
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

- **`probe`** is how flutterware finds out whether the stack is up. It runs
  every few seconds while the panel is on screen (`poll:` sets the pace).
- **`start`** and **`stop`** are optional. Leave both out for a service you only
  watch, like a shared server.
- **`commands`** are extra buttons: logs, restart, reset. Mark one
  `danger: true` if it destroys data, and set `stopIsDestructive: true` when
  stopping drops your database; the studio asks before running those.

Commands run from the root of the checkout unless you set `workingDirectory:`.

### Two ways to run something

`StackRun.command([...])` runs an executable directly. There's no shell, so
pipes and `$(...)` need `sh -c`, as in the probe above.

`StackRun.script('tool/stack.dart', args: ['up'])` runs a Dart script from your
project with the same Dart SDK flutterware runs on. Use it when the logic is
more than one line, or to avoid depending on what's on the `PATH` of a studio
started from the Dock.

### Two kinds of probe

`Probe.exitCode(...)`: exit code 0 means up, anything else means down. The last
line of output is shown as the detail. Make sure the command fails when the
stack is down: `docker compose ps --quiet` succeeds and prints nothing, which
would read as "up" forever.

`Probe.json(...)`: the command prints one JSON object, which can say more:

```json
{
  "state": "up",
  "detail": "4 containers",
  "services": [{"name": "postgres", "port": 5432, "state": "up"}]
}
```

`state` is `down`, `starting`, `up`, `stopping` or `unavailable` (the probe
itself couldn't tell). With `services`, a stack that's partly up shows as
`up 3/4` instead of a single colour.

## From the command line or an agent

```shell
fw run dev_stack status     # runs the probe now
fw run dev_stack logs       # a declared command, by its id
```
