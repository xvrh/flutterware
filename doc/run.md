# Run

Launch your app on any device from the studio, then watch it and drive it while
it runs: logs, network calls, the widget tree, device settings, and taps and
typing from the studio, the command line or a coding agent.

## Turn it on

```dart
// tool/flutterware.dart
fw.use(
  Run(
    packages: [
      RunPackage(
        app,
        entrypoints: [
          Entrypoint(
            'lib/main.dart',
            name: 'Brewline',
            description: 'The coffee shop',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

Leave `entrypoints` empty and every file directly in `lib/` with a `main()` is
offered.
Naming them is worth it: the name and description are what you, and an agent,
pick from.

## Launch

In the studio, **Run** opens on a launch form: pick an entry point and a
device, then Launch. Phones, emulators, simulators and the desktop all work,
including a physical iPhone once its Xcode signing is set up. Several apps can
run at once, on different devices or from different worktrees.

From the command line:

```shell
fw run run devices                                    # what can run, and what is running
fw run run launch --device=macos --entrypoint=lib/main.dart --wait=true
fw run run reload                                     # hot reload
fw run run restart                                    # hot restart
fw run run stop
```

## While it runs

The run's tabs:

- **Screen**: the app's current screen, with an inspector for its widget
  tree.
- **Steps**: every action the command line or an agent sent to the app, each
  with the screen it produced, and your own taps in between.
- **Logs**: what the app printed, what the build said, and the platform's
  native log, where plugins report whether push, purchases or the camera
  worked.
- **Network**: the app's HTTP requests; open one for its headers, body and
  timings. It reads Flutter's own HTTP profiling, so the app needs no wrapper
  or special client.
- **App**: panels your app declares through its devbar, such as feature flags
  or a simulated push notification.
- **Knobs**: the entry point's knobs (see below).

On Android and on the iOS simulator, a strip above the screen changes
the device's appearance, text size, orientation, language and accessibility
settings, and shows what each one is currently set to.

## Knobs

A knob is an optional named parameter of your `main`:

```dart
void main({
  String apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com',
  bool mockPayments = false,
}) {
  runApp(ShopApp(apiUrl: apiUrl, mockPayments: mockPayments));
}
```

Plain `flutter run` still calls `main()` and gets the defaults. Launched from
flutterware, each parameter is a control on the **Knobs** tab, and changing one
costs a hot restart instead of a rebuild. An `enum` parameter becomes a picker
on its own. For anything the signature can't say, annotate it in
`tool/flutterware.dart` with `Knob('apiUrl', options: […])` on the entry point.

A flavored app lists its flavors on the package with `flavors:`, and each
entry point names the one it's built with: `Entrypoint(…, flavor: 'staging')`,
or `flavorByPlatform:` when that differs between Android and iOS.

## Drive it

An app launched by flutterware can be driven: every action finds its target,
checks it can actually be reached, performs it, waits for the screen to
settle, and answers with what is on screen now.

```shell
fw run run observe                                  # what's on screen
fw run run act --verb=tap --target='Cappuccino'
fw run run act --verb=enterText --target='{"key": "shop.cupName"}' --text='Ada'
fw run run act --verb=scroll --target='The menu' --dy=600
fw run run act --verb=back
```

The verbs are `tap`, `doubleTap`, `longPress`, `secondaryTap`, `hover`,
`unhover`, `drag`, `scroll`, `scrollTo`, `enterText`, `key`, `back`, `wait`,
`navigate` and `observe`. A target is visible text, or JSON for a key, a
semantics label, a tooltip, a widget inside another, or a point.

A wrong target never succeeds quietly: if it matches nothing or several things,
the answer lists what is on screen so the next try can be exact.

An agent does the same over MCP with `flutterware_act`, and gets a screenshot
and the visible texts back with each step, so it can edit code, hot reload and
look again in about two seconds. You're sharing the app with it: your own taps
show up in its next answer, and its steps show up on your **Steps** tab.

### What Flutter can't see

Permission dialogs, web views and other apps belong to the platform, not to the
Flutter widget tree. Add `--layer=native` to `act` or `observe` to address the
platform's accessibility tree instead, and `--verb=foreground` brings a
backgrounded iOS app back without restarting it. It's slower, and it's there
for the moments the app hands over to the system.

## Reference

Every action and its options, including `inspect`, `screenshot`, `network` and
`setDevice`:
