# Store screenshots

Make the images for your App Store and Google Play listings from your
[scenarios](scenarios.md): every store, every display size, every language, in
one command. The design around the app is a Flutter widget you write, so it can
do anything Flutter can draw.

![Four finished App Store images from the demo: a headline over a tilted phone
on each, with one continuous scene running behind all four](screenshots/store_strip.png)

These are the first four images the demo exports for the 6.9" iPhone slot.
The hills behind them are one drawing, split across the set.

## How it works

1. Your scenarios name the screens worth showing, with `shot: Shot('Menu')`.
2. `tool/flutterware.dart` says which stores you ship to and in which languages.
3. `fw run store export` runs those scenarios once per store device and
   language, draws your frame around each named shot, and writes the images at
   the exact size each store asks for.

The export lands in a folder that `fastlane deliver` and `fastlane supply` read
as it is.

## Turn it on

```dart
// tool/flutterware.dart
fw.use(
  StoreShots(
    apps: [
      StoreShotsApp(
        app,
        file: 'test/scenarios/shop_test.dart',
        frame: 'lib/store_frame.dart',
        listings: [
          Listing.appStore(locales: {'en': 'en-US', 'fr': 'fr-FR'}),
          Listing.play(locales: {'en': 'en-US', 'fr': 'fr-FR'}),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

- `file` is the scenario file (or folder) the shots come from. Shots are
  numbered in the order they're captured, so this file is where the order of
  your listing is decided. Leave it out and every scenario in the package runs,
  which is rarely the story you want to tell.
- `tag` keeps only shots carrying that tag, like `Shot('Home', tags: ['store'])`.
  It's how a screen from a long scenario gets into the listing without
  rewriting anything.
- `locales` maps your app's language to the store's name for it. The two
  don't always match, so you write both.
- `frame` is optional; see below.

## The sizes are the stores'

You never type a pixel size. Each listing brings its own:

| Store | Slot | Rendered as | Image |
|---|---|---|---|
| App Store | iPhone 6.9" | iPhone 16 Pro Max | 1320×2868 |
| App Store | iPad 13" | iPad Pro 13" | 2048×2732 |
| Google Play | Phone | a 20:9 Android phone | 1080×2160 |
| Google Play | 10" tablet | an Android tablet | 1600×2560 |

Apple scales these two to its smaller slots. Google Play needs one extra step:
it refuses images taller than twice their width, and modern Android phones are
taller than that. So a Play phone image is always a composition, with the real
phone screen placed on a 2:1 canvas. If you don't declare a frame, that one set
gets a plain default frame and the others keep the app's own pixels.

`Listing.appStore(classes: …)` and `Listing.play(classes: …)` narrow the slots
if you don't ship to all of them.

## Write a frame

A frame is a widget that receives one shot and draws the image around it:

```dart
// lib/store_frame.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterware/store.dart';

StoreFrame storeFrame(StoreShot shot) => CoffeeStoreFrame(shot);

class CoffeeStoreFrame extends StoreFrame {
  const CoffeeStoreFrame(super.shot, {super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SizedBox(
      width: shot.canvas.logicalWidth,
      height: shot.canvas.logicalHeight,
      child: Stack(
        children: [
          Positioned.fill(child: ColoredBox(color: Color(0xFF2C1B14))),
          Positioned(
            left: 24,
            right: 24,
            bottom: 0,
            child: Image(image: shot.image),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The file must export a top-level `storeFrame`. The `StoreShot` it gets carries:

- `image`: the app's screen for this shot, and `set`: every screen in the set.
- `index` and `total`: where this image sits in the listing.
- `slug` (like `order-placed`), `locale` and `device`: enough to pick a
  headline per shot and per language.
- `canvas`: the size to fill, in the same logical pixels the app was laid out
  in, so a 16pt caption looks like one.
- `panoramaWidth` and `panoramaOffset`: draw one background as wide as the
  whole set, shift it by the offset, and consecutive images join up exactly.

The demo's [frame](../examples/brewline/lib/store_frame.dart) uses all of
this: tilted phones with their shadows, a headline read from a per-language
file, and a scene continuing from one image to the next.

## Export and look

```shell
fw run store export                          # everything declared
fw run store export --listing=play --locale=fr
fw run store open                            # the output folder, in your file manager
```

The images go to `build/flutterware/store/<app>/`, in fastlane's layout:
`ios/<locale>/` for the App Store and `android/<locale>/images/phoneScreenshots/`
for Play. The app's unframed pixels are kept beside them under `unframed/`.
Set `output:` on the app to write somewhere else, and
`layout: StoreLayout.plain` for a layout without fastlane's folder names.

![The store panel: one row of finished images per display class, with a note
that only the first ten will be published](screenshots/card_store.png)

The **Store** panel shows the last export: one row per store slot, in listing
order, for the language picked at the top. A set with more images than the
store accepts (ten per slot on the App Store, eight on Play) is shown in full,
with the extra ones marked.
