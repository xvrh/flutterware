# Database watch — your app's sqlite, on every surface

Hand the devbar a `DatabaseAdapter` and the running app's database becomes a
panel: browse the schema, run a query, pin a live query, follow the writes —
from the cockpit's App tab, from `fw run run`, from an agent over MCP, on any
device the run cockpit reaches. Nothing here needs a rebuild to inspect, and
it works on a physical phone, where the database file itself is sealed inside
the app sandbox (design doc:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-sqlite-watch-design.md`).

flutterware imports no sqlite. The adapter is four function types and a name;
you wire it to whatever database library you use and own those five lines.

## The recipe: sqlite_async (and PowerSync)

`PowerSyncDatabase` implements sqlite_async's interface, so the same lines
cover both. A live version is
[`examples/example/lib/shop_devbar.dart`](../examples/example/lib/shop_devbar.dart).

```dart
import 'package:flutterware/devbar.dart';

Devbar(
  plugins: [
    DatabasePlugin.init(
      database: DatabaseAdapter(
        query: (sql, args) => db.getAll(sql, args),
        updates: db.updates.map((u) => u.tables),
        watch: (sql) =>
            db.watch(sql, throttle: const Duration(milliseconds: 250)),
      ),
    ),
  ],
  child: ...,
)
```

- `query` should be a **read path**. sqlite_async's `getAll` runs on the
  read pool, which sqlite itself enforces read-only — a write smuggled into
  a query dies with `attempt to write a readonly database`, measured, not
  assumed.
- `updates` powers the `changes` feed: which tables changed, per write
  transaction, coalesced over 250ms so a sync burst reads as one event
  rather than two hundred.
- `watch` is optional. Without it a watched query re-runs on every coalesced
  tick; with it, sqlite_async re-runs only when the query's own source
  tables change. Pass a `throttle` around 250ms — the library's 30ms default
  produces a dozen snapshots during a burst.
- Two databases are two `DatabasePlugin.init` calls with two
  `DatabaseAdapter(name: ...)`s: panels `db:main` and `db:cache`.

## Writes are opt-in, by existence

There is no flag. Provide `execute` and an `Execute SQL` action exists,
marked danger on every surface; leave it out and no surface — agents
included — can see a write door at all:

```dart
DatabaseAdapter(
  query: (sql, args) => db.getAll(sql, args),
  updates: db.updates.map((u) => u.tables),
  execute: (sql, args) => db.execute(sql, args),  // the whole opt-in
)
```

## What you get on the wire

- **`schema`** (state) — tables *and views*, columns, row counts, read
  live. Each entry carries its `type`, so a database that presents itself
  through views — PowerSync, where every schema table is a view over a
  `ps_data__*` table — reads as itself rather than as its storage.
- **`query`** (action) — one statement, rows inline, capped at `limit`
  (default 100) with a `truncated` flag rather than a silent cut. The cap
  protects the reply, not the fetch: put a `LIMIT` in the SQL to page a big
  table.
- **`changes`** (feed) — coalesced table-level ticks.
- **`watch` / `unwatch`** (actions) + **`watch`** (feed) — every result
  snapshot of every watched query, rows riding in the lazily-fetched
  details; a broken query reports its error on the feed and stops. Each
  snapshot offers **`explain`** — `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` for the query the row
  belongs to.

From an agent, one call each:

```sh
fw run run panelInvoke --panel=db:main --action=query \
  --args='{"sql": "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = ?", "args": "[\"open\"]"}'
```
