# Server inspection — adapter snippets

**This is for Dart servers, and the reason is the import.** A server announces
itself by importing `package:flutterware/server.dart` in its own process and
calling into it, so what it inspects is whatever runs Dart. A backend written
in anything else — a .NET or Go API beside your Flutter app, which is an
ordinary shape for a repo to have — gets nothing from this and cannot be made
to: there is no out-of-process shipper, no agent and no log format to point at
it, and none is planned. A mixed-stack repo should expect to inspect its Dart
services here and its others wherever it already does.

`package:flutterware/server.dart` ships **primitives only**: `event`,
`span`/`spanSync`, `handle`, and zone correlation. Everything that binds them
to a specific framework or driver is a snippet on this page that you paste
into your server and own — deliberately, so the package stays dependency-free
and the redaction and capture policy is code you can read and edit (design
doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-server-inspection-design.md`,
decisions 5 and 11).

A live, runnable version of the shelf + logging snippets is
[`examples/example/bin/example_server.dart`](../examples/example/bin/example_server.dart).

Everything below is inert in release builds (`dart compile` / `dart build`)
and on machines without `~/.flutterware/run`; there is no init call — the
first event publishes the server.

## Describe the server: `FlutterwareServer.info`

The one piece that is typed API rather than a snippet, because both halves
speak it: where the server listens, which environment, what it talks to,
and the pages worth a click. The GUI's Info tab renders it, the environment
chip and base URL sit beside the panel tabs, and `flutterware_invoke`'s
`info` action returns it to agents.

```dart
var server = await shelf_io.serve(handler, InternetAddress.loopbackIPv4, 8080);

FlutterwareServer.info(ServerInfo(
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:${server.port}',   // after serve — the real port
  environment: 'dev',
  links: [
    ServerLink('Health', '/health'),            // relative resolves via baseUrl
    ServerLink('API docs', '/docs', description: 'OpenAPI UI'),
  ],
  connections: [
    ServerConnection('postgres', connectionString, label: 'main'),
  ],
  config: {
    'Feature flags': {'newCheckout': true},
  },
));
```

Call it again any time — each call replaces only the sections it names, so
re-publishing `config:` after a flag flips leaves the links alone.
Passwords in a DSN and secret-shaped config keys (`apiKey`, `token`, …) are
masked wherever they are displayed, with click-to-reveal in the GUI; still,
publish only what you are willing to have on a developer's screen.

`baseUrl` and `environment` are also mirrored into the server's handle
file, so `fw status` and the GUI's sidebar can say
`pid 4242 · http://localhost:8080 · dev` without attaching — and a request
in the GUI gains a **copy as curl** button, built from `baseUrl` plus the
captured headers and body.

## HTTP in: shelf middleware

One `runZoned` is the whole correlation story: every query and log line
emitted below it is stamped with this request's id, which is what builds the
per-request waterfall and the N+1 badge.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutterware/server.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';

Middleware inspect() {
  var nextRequestId = 1;
  return (inner) => (request) {
    var id = 'req-${nextRequestId++}';
    return runZoned(() async {
      var watch = Stopwatch()..start();
      try {
        var response = await inner(request);
        FlutterwareServer.event('http', {
          'method': request.method,
          'path': '/${request.url.path}',
          'status': response.statusCode,
          'ms': watch.elapsedMicroseconds / 1000,
        });
        return response;
      } on HijackException {
        // Shelf signals a hijack — a websocket upgrade, an SSE stream taking
        // the socket — by *throwing* past the middleware. It is the success
        // path. Caught below as an error, every websocket connection posts a
        // phantom 500 to the timeline, and the one it posts for is the
        // connection that worked.
        rethrow;
      } catch (e) {
        FlutterwareServer.event('http', {
          'method': request.method,
          'path': '/${request.url.path}',
          'status': 500,
          'ms': watch.elapsedMicroseconds / 1000,
          'error': '$e',
        });
        rethrow;
      }
    }, zoneValues: {FlutterwareServer.requestIdKey: id});
  };
}

// var handler = const Pipeline().addMiddleware(inspect()).addHandler(router);
```

A hijacked request is reported by nothing here, which is the honest answer:
the response never existed and the socket's life is no longer the handler's.
To see that the upgrade happened, report an `event` of your own before the
hijack — the correlation zone is still yours at that point.

The version in `example_server.dart` goes further and is the one to copy for
the Request/Response tabs: it captures **redacted headers** and **capped
textual bodies** into the event's lazy `details:` — held server-side, fetched
only when someone opens the tab. The capture cut (decision 11): textual
content types with a known length under 32 KB are buffered; streams and
everything else are recorded as size only, because interposing on a stream is
exactly the overhead this design refuses. Redaction lives in that snippet —
in code you own — not in the library.

## Logs: package:logging

The listener runs in whatever zone called `listen`, so correlation must come
from `record.zone` — the zone the log call happened in. Without that, log
lines lose their request id.

```dart
Logger.root.onRecord.listen((record) {
  (record.zone ?? Zone.current).run(() {
    FlutterwareServer.event('log', {
      'level': record.level.name,
      'logger': record.loggerName,
      'message': record.message,
      if (record.error != null) 'error': '${record.error}',
    });
  });
});
```

## Uncaught errors, outside any request

The middleware already reports a handler that throws. For everything else —
timers, queue consumers, fire-and-forget futures — wrap `main`'s body:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  await runZonedGuarded(() async {
    // ... start the server ...
  }, (error, stackTrace) {
    FlutterwareServer.event('log', {
      'level': 'SEVERE',
      'message': 'uncaught: $error',
      'error': '$stackTrace',
    });
  });
}
```

### What counts as an error

The Errors tab and the `errors` action admit three things, and only the first
is about the response:

- an `http` event whose `status` is **500 or more**;
- a `log` event at **`SEVERE`** or **`SHOUT`**;
- **any event carrying an `error` key**, on any channel.

So what lands there depends on how your project logs, not only on what it
answered. A 403 whose handler logs with `error:` attached shows up — through
the third rule, not the first. A 4xx handler that logs at `INFO` with no error
attached shows up nowhere, for a request that failed. That is deliberate: a 404
is traffic, not a fault, and only your code knows which of yours are which.
Attach `error:` to the log line for the ones that are.

When the question really is about the status, ask it directly:
`errors` takes `minStatus`, which replaces the three rules above with that one
comparison — `minStatus: 400` is every request that failed, whatever the logger
was doing.

## SQL: drift

`QueryInterceptor` is the one hook that sees every statement. The `explain`
and `requery` handlers run **inside your server, on your own connection** —
that is why the GUI needs no driver and no credentials to show a real plan.

**Report the statement as the driver received it, and report its parameters
beside it.** Substituting values into the text would break the grouping the SQL
tab is built on — `normalizeSql` gathers occurrences by shape, and an N+1 is
exactly a set of queries differing only in their literals. So `$1` / `@name` /
`?` stay where they are, which means the text alone will not run: `EXPLAIN` on
it fails, because a parameter has no meaning outside a prepared statement.
A command is therefore invoked with `params` as well as `query` — the chosen
occurrence's own, as your `span` reported them — and every handler below binds
them rather than interpolating. A statement that took no parameters arrives
without the key.

Report them in the shape your driver binds: a list where the placeholders are
positional, a **map where they are named**. `parameters.values.toList()` on a
named query throws the names away, and the names are the half that binds back.

```dart
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';
import 'package:flutterware/server.dart';

class InspectingInterceptor extends QueryInterceptor {
  @override
  Future<T> _run<T>(String sql, List<Object?> args, Future<T> Function() body) {
    return FlutterwareServer.span('sql', {
      'query': sql,
      if (args.isNotEmpty) 'params': args,
    }, body);
    // For selects, prefer reporting the row count too — it is what the
    // occurrence rows show: run the body yourself, then
    // FlutterwareServer.event('sql', {..., 'rows': result.length, 'ms': …}).
  }

  @override
  Future<List<Map<String, Object?>>> runSelect(
    QueryExecutor executor,
    String statement,
    List<Object?> args,
  ) => _run(statement, args, () => executor.runSelect(statement, args));

  // Override runInsert / runUpdate / runDelete / runCustom the same way.
}

// db = MyDatabase(executor.interceptWith(InspectingInterceptor()));

void registerSqlCommands(MyDatabase db) {
  FlutterwareServer.handle('sql', 'explain', (params) async {
    var rows = await db
        .customSelect(
          'EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN ${params['query']}',
          variables: _bind(params['params']),
        )
        .get();
    return {'plan': [for (var row in rows) row.data]};
  });
  FlutterwareServer.handle('sql', 'requery', (params) async {
    var rows = await db
        .customSelect(
          params['query']! as String,
          variables: _bind(params['params']),
        )
        .get();
    return {'rows': [for (var row in rows.take(50)) row.data]};
  });
}

/// The parameters as they crossed the wire, back into drift variables. They
/// arrive JSON-shaped, so a `DateTime` is the string the reporter recorded —
/// good enough for a plan, and the reason `requery` is for dev databases.
List<Variable> _bind(Object? reported) => [
  for (var value in reported as List? ?? const []) Variable(value),
];
```

## SQL: package:postgres

```dart
import 'package:flutterware/server.dart';
import 'package:postgres/postgres.dart';

Future<Result> query(
  Connection connection,
  String sql, {
  Map<String, Object?>? parameters,
}) {
  return FlutterwareServer.span('sql', {
    'query': sql,
    // The map, not `parameters.values.toList()`: this query is named, so a
    // list is the half of it that cannot be bound back.
    if (parameters != null) 'params': parameters,
  }, () => connection.execute(Sql.named(sql), parameters: parameters));
}

void registerSqlCommands(Connection connection) {
  FlutterwareServer.handle('sql', 'explain', (params) async {
    var rows = await connection.execute(
      Sql.named('EXPLAIN ANALYZE ${params['query']}'),
      parameters: (params['params'] as Map?)?.cast<String, Object?>(),
    );
    return {'plan': [for (var row in rows) row.first]};
  });
  FlutterwareServer.handle('sql', 'requery', (params) async {
    var rows = await connection.execute(
      Sql.named(params['query']! as String),
      parameters: (params['params'] as Map?)?.cast<String, Object?>(),
    );
    return {'rows': [for (var row in rows.take(50)) row.toColumnMap()]};
  });
}
```

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` **executes** the query. For statements with side effects,
or on data you care about, use plain `EXPLAIN` instead.

## SQL: package:sqlite3

```dart
import 'package:flutterware/server.dart';
import 'package:sqlite3/sqlite3.dart';

ResultSet query(Database db, String sql, [List<Object?> params = const []]) {
  return FlutterwareServer.spanSync('sql', {
    'query': sql,
    if (params.isNotEmpty) 'params': params,
  }, () => db.select(sql, params));
}

void registerSqlCommands(Database db) {
  FlutterwareServer.handle('sql', 'explain', (params) {
    var rows = db.select(
      'EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN ${params['query']}',
      _bind(params['params']),
    );
    return {'plan': [for (var row in rows) row['detail']]};
  });
  FlutterwareServer.handle('sql', 'requery', (params) {
    var rows = db.select(params['query']! as String, _bind(params['params']));
    return {'rows': rows.take(50).toList()};
  });
}

List<Object?> _bind(Object? reported) => [...?reported as List?];
```

## HTTP out: the other half of a slow endpoint

Outgoing calls your handlers make, reported into the same waterfall:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:flutterware/server.dart';

class InspectingClient extends http.BaseClient {
  InspectingClient(this._inner);
  final http.Client _inner;

  @override
  Future<http.StreamedResponse> send(http.BaseRequest request) {
    return FlutterwareServer.span('http-out', {
      'method': request.method,
      'url': '${request.url}',
    }, () => _inner.send(request));
  }
}
```

## Notes that apply to every snippet

- **Redaction is yours**: before reporting headers or parameters, drop what
  must not leave the process. The snippets above report no headers for exactly
  that reason — add them consciously.

  **Build the list by grepping your handlers for the headers they read, not
  from a list of usual suspects.** `Authorization`, `Cookie` and password
  fields are where everyone starts and where no real server ends: a project
  that accepts `x-authorization` as a fallback for `authorization` has a
  credential no outside list names, and it is one grep away from being found.
  The same grep catches the other half — a `x-publishable-key` is *publishable*,
  and redacting it costs you which integrator a request came from, which is
  half of why anyone opens the panel. Redact what your code treats as a secret;
  leave what it treats as an identity.
- **`requery` re-executes the statement.** Registering it for a toy or a
  local dev database is convenient; think before registering it against
  anything shared.
- Every handler answer must be JSON-encodable; cap row counts (`take(50)`)
  — the wire is for inspection, not for bulk export.
