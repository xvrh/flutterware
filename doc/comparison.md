# Comparison

See what a branch changed on screen before you merge it. `fw compare` renders
your [previews](previews.md) and replays your [scenarios](scenarios.md) on
both your branch and its base, then reports every screen that moved: the
pixels, the widget tree, the visible text and the events the app recorded.

There are no golden files to keep up to date and nothing to approve. Both
sides are built from git when you ask, so the base is always the real base.

## Run it

```shell
fw compare                         # against the default base
fw compare --base=origin/release   # against any ref git can name
fw compare --entry='demo/shop.dart#shopMenu'
```

The base is the one set in `tool/flutterware.dart`
(`fw.changes(ChangesConfig(base: …))`), or else `origin/HEAD`, `main` or
`master`, whichever exists first.

Entries whose code the branch didn't touch are skipped without being
rendered, so a branch that changed no widget code finishes almost at once.

The result lands in an `index.json` (its path is printed last) and on the
**Changes** screen of the studio, beside the diff. Each changed screen shows
both sides and what differs between them.

## On a pull request

```shell
fw compare --export                          # a browsable page, in build/comparison/web
fw compare --report=build/comparison-report  # what a PR comment needs
```

`--export` writes a static page (a viewer, the `index.json` and one PNG per
frame) that works from any web host, including a per-PR folder. Serve it over
HTTP; opened as a local file it can't load its own frames.

`--report` writes a `comment.md` and a `mosaic.png` of the changed screens,
with the exported page under `web/`. The comment uses `__MOSAIC_URL__` and
`__VIEWER_URL__` placeholders, for your workflow to replace once it has
uploaded the files.

## In CI

`fw compare` exits 1 only when a side produced no answer at all, for example
when the base doesn't build. Changed screens don't fail it: a branch is
supposed to change things. To gate on changes, read `index.json`;
`package:flutterware/comparison_report.dart` reads it, typed.

reference](../docs/capabilities.md#fw).
